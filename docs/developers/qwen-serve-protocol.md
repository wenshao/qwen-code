# `qwen serve` HTTP protocol reference

Stage 1 of the [qwen-code daemon design](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/3803). All routes live under the daemon's base URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:4170`).

This reference describes HTTP routes and SSE framing. Read it together with
the [typed event schema](./daemon/09-event-schema.md) for payload contracts,
resync reasons, and history anchors, the
[event bus and replay guide](./daemon/10-event-bus.md) for delivery and
backpressure, and [capabilities and versioning](./daemon/11-capabilities-versioning.md)
for the existing `v1` protocol and compatibility rules. The
[daemon documentation index](./daemon/00-index.md) links the full contract set.

## Authentication

When the daemon was started with `--token` or `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` — or bound non-loopback with neither, which generates an ephemeral bearer and prints it once at startup — **every normal API route except `/health` on ordinary loopback binds** must carry:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Without a configured token on the loopback default, the header is optional and requests arriving through the primary listener have full operator API authority. Workspace trust, session ownership, `X-Qwen-Client-Id`, permission, feature, validation, and resource checks still apply. Token comparison is constant-time. 401 responses are uniform across `missing header` / `wrong scheme` / `wrong token`.

**`--open-with-auth`.** This default-off CLI mode requires a loopback bind and an available Web Shell. It reuses the normal `--token`-over-`QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` selection, or generates 32 random bytes encoded as base64url before daemon startup when that selection is empty. The browser receives the selected bearer through `#token=` and stores it per tab; the protocol and middleware see an ordinary configured token. Fragment delivery keys on the resolved token, not on this flag: any `--open` launch attaches the resolved bearer — configured or generated — to the launched URL's `#token=` fragment (visible to local users via `ps` / `/proc`, as the launcher warns), so a non-loopback bind with bare `--open` hands its generated bearer to the browser the same way; this flag's distinct contributions are token _generation_ on loopback and the browser-ineligible manual-URL fallback. Only direct embedded callers that ignore `RunHandle.resolvedToken`, and clients that never launch a browser, receive no automatic credential. Browser-ineligible environments print the secret-bearing fragment URL for manual opening. Loopback `/health` and static Web Shell assets retain the exemptions described below; `--require-auth` still gates `/health`.

Channel webhook ingress (`POST /channels/:channelName/webhooks/:source`) is separate from this bearer contract in every mode. When mounted, it is registered before `bearerAuth` and authenticates with its configured `x-qwen-webhook-secret`; rotating the daemon bearer does not rotate webhook source secrets.

**`/health` exemption** (Bctum): on loopback binds (`127.0.0.0/8` / `localhost` / `::1` / `[::1]`) `/health` is registered BEFORE the bearer middleware, so liveness probes inside the pod don't need to carry the token even when the daemon was started with `--token`. Non-loopback binds (`--hostname 0.0.0.0` etc.) gate `/health` with the other normal API routes — see the [`GET /health`](#get-health) section for the rationale.

**`--require-auth` (#4175 PR 15).** Pass this flag at boot to extend the "must have a token" rule to loopback as well. Boot fails when no token source resolves — on loopback that means `--token`, `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`, or `--open-with-auth` (which installs its own generated token before boot, so `--require-auth --open-with-auth` starts). The fail-fast is loopback-only: a non-loopback bind resolves the ephemeral bearer it generates when neither configured source is present, and that satisfies the flag. The `/health` exemption is dropped either way, so `/health` also requires `Authorization: Bearer …`.

When the flag is on, the global `bearerAuth` middleware gates **every normal API route** — including `/health` and `/capabilities`. Channel webhook ingress remains independently shared-secret-authenticated, and Web Shell document and asset routes remain pre-auth. An **unauthenticated** client therefore cannot pre-flight `caps.features` to discover that auth is required: the discovery surface for that case is the **401 response body** itself (uniform across bearer-gated routes per the [Authentication](#authentication) section). The `require_auth` capability tag is a **post-authentication confirmation** — once a client successfully authenticates and reads `/capabilities`, the tag's presence confirms the daemon was started with `--require-auth` (useful for audit / compliance UIs and for SDK clients to surface "this deployment is hardened" in a settings panel). Strict mutation routes accept trusted-loopback primary-listener requests, bearer-authenticated requests, or paired Local Control requests. Non-trusted token-less embeds still receive `401 { code: "token_required", error: "…" }`; with `--require-auth`, global bearer middleware rejects first with the legacy `Unauthorized` body.

**`--allow-origin <pattern>` (T2.4 [#4514](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4514)).** Browser clients hitting the daemon cross-origin are blocked by default — a request carrying an `Origin` header returns `403 {"error":"Request denied by CORS policy"}` because CLI/SDK clients never send `Origin` and the daemon treats its presence as a sign the request came from a browser context the operator has not opted into. One exception precedes the wall on a non-loopback bind with a token: a same-origin request (`Origin` equal to the direct socket scheme plus the normalized `Host` authority) is bearer-authenticated and its `Origin` stripped **on the primary listener** — with a valid bearer the route's own status follows, with a missing or invalid bearer a `401`, **except the pre-auth Web Shell document, `/assets/*`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/sw.js`, and `/mcp-app-sandbox` routes, which are served without a credential as in every other mode** — and only cross-origin or non-matching `Origin` values keep the `403` envelope. Pass `--allow-origin <pattern>` (repeatable) at boot to install an allowlist instead of the wall. Each pattern is either:

- The literal `*` — admit any origin. **Risky**: boot refuses when `*` is configured but no bearer token resolves. The guard reads the _resolved_ token — `--token`, `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`, `--open-with-auth`'s generated loopback token, or the ephemeral bearer a non-loopback bind generates when neither configured source is present — so this refusal is loopback-only. The boot breadcrumb emits a stderr warning when `*` is in the list. **Recommendation**: pair with `--require-auth` on loopback binds so `/health` is also gated by the bearer — it's registered before the bearer middleware on loopback by default (so k8s/Compose probes can reach it without a token), and a `*` allowlist makes it reachable from any cross-origin browser. `--require-auth` still leaves the Web Shell static assets (`/`, `/assets/*`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/sw.js`, and `/session/:id`, `/plugins`, `/channels`, `/scheduled-tasks`, `/goals`, and `/settings` document navigations) pre-auth on loopback by design — they are mounted before the bearer middleware — so under a `*` allowlist they remain readable from any cross-origin browser; `--no-web` removes that surface. On non-loopback binds the bearer is already mandatory at boot and `/health` is registered behind it. Normal API routes are bearer-gated, channel webhook ingress retains its own shared-secret gate, and Web Shell static assets (`/`, `/assets/*`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/sw.js`, and `/session/:id`, `/plugins`, `/channels`, `/scheduled-tasks`, `/goals`, and `/settings` document navigations) remain pre-auth unless `--no-web` removes them.
- A canonical URL origin — `<scheme>://<host>[:<port>]`. **No trailing slash, no path, no userinfo, no query.** Boot refuses with `InvalidAllowOriginPatternError` if the entry fails the round-trip `new URL(pattern).origin === pattern`; the error message names the bad pattern and the canonical form. Strict-by-intent: silent normalization (e.g. trimming a trailing `/`) would let typos slip through and accept ambiguous input. Without a resolved token — which after generation means a loopback bind — HTTP(S) entries are limited to loopback hosts; a non-loopback browser origin requires a token because it can otherwise drive the full operator API, including code execution as the daemon user. Explicit browser-extension origins keep their existing tokenless local-automation path. Startup logs the authority granted to any tokenless allowed browser origin.

Matched origins receive the standard CORS response headers on every request:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <echoed origin>
Vary: Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, X-Qwen-Client-Id, Last-Event-ID, X-Qwen-Event-Epoch
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Retry-After, X-Qwen-Event-Epoch, X-Qwen-SSE-Stream-Id
```

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` echoes the request's origin verbatim (lowercase / uppercase as the browser sent it) rather than the literal `*`, even under the `*` pattern — browser caches key responses on it paired with `Vary: Origin`, and echoing leaves room to add `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` in a later release without a schema change. The exposed headers let browser clients honor retry hints, retain the SSE epoch, and correlate accepted physical streams. `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is **NOT** sent today: configured daemon credentials use bearer-in-`Authorization`, which works cross-origin without `credentials: 'include'`; trusted-loopback authority needs no browser credential.

OPTIONS preflight requests (OPTIONS with `Access-Control-Request-Method` or `Access-Control-Request-Headers`) short-circuit with `204 No Content` plus the headers above. This is the conventional CORS pattern and is safe — the preflight only confirms which methods/headers the daemon will accept; the actual subsequent request still runs the Host gate and then either bearer/listener authority or the channel webhook shared-secret gate before any state is read or mutated. Plain OPTIONS requests from matched origins keep flowing downstream with CORS headers attached.

Origins that don't match the allowlist still get `403 {"error":"Request denied by CORS policy"}` — same envelope as the default wall, so clients that already parsed the wall's response don't have to special-case allowlist-deployed daemons. The reject path **does not** emit any `Access-Control-*` headers (the browser would ignore them, and emitting would indirectly advertise the allowlist size through header presence).

The configured pattern list is intentionally NOT echoed in `/capabilities` — a browser client already knows its own origin (it called the daemon, after all), and surfacing the list would let an unauthenticated reader of `/capabilities` enumerate every trusted origin (useful recon for a misconfigured deployment). SDK clients gate on the `caps.features.allow_origin` tag for "this daemon honors cross-origin browser hits" without needing to know which specific origins.

Loopback self-origin requests (e.g. the Web Shell calling the daemon at the same `127.0.0.1:port`) are handled by a **separate** Origin-strip shim that runs BEFORE the CORS middleware and removes the `Origin` header for `127.0.0.1:port` / `localhost:port` / `[::1]:port` / `host.docker.internal:port` or the exact bound loopback address and port. It also accepts the scheme-matched port-less forms that browsers send for default ports: `http://host` on port 80 and `https://host` on port 443. These requests pass through regardless of `--allow-origin` configuration — operators don't need to list the daemon's own port to make the Web Shell work.

## Common error shape

5xx responses carry the original error's `code` and `data` when present (JSON-RPC style — the ACP SDK forwards `{code, message, data}` from the agent):

```json
{
  "error": "Internal error",
  "code": -32000,
  "data": { "reason": "model quota exceeded" }
}
```

Malformed JSON in a request body returns:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid JSON in request body" }
```

with status `400`.

`SessionNotFoundError` for an unknown session id returns:

```json
{
  "error": "No session with id \"<sid>\"",
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "code": "session_not_found"
}
```

with status `404`. A concurrent close uses `code: "session_closing"`.

`WorkspaceMismatchError` for a `POST /session` whose `cwd` doesn't canonicalize to a registered workspace returns `400` with:

```json
{
  "error": "Workspace mismatch: daemon is bound to \"…\"",
  "code": "workspace_mismatch",
  "boundWorkspace": "/path/the/daemon/uses/as-primary",
  "requestedWorkspace": "/path/in/the/request"
}
```

Use this to detect mismatch pre-flight: read `workspaceCwd` off `/capabilities` and omit `cwd` from `POST /session` (it falls back to the primary workspace), or when `multi_workspace_sessions` is advertised choose one of `workspaces[].cwd`.

`POST /session` past the daemon's `--max-sessions` cap returns `503` with a `Retry-After: 5` header and:

```json
{
  "error": "Session limit reached (20)",
  "code": "session_limit_exceeded",
  "limit": 20,
  "scope": "workspace"
}
```

When the effective daemon-wide total cap rejects a fresh session — `--max-total-sessions`, or the default described under `limits.maxTotalSessions` — the same response shape is returned with `"scope": "total"`.

Attaches to existing sessions are NOT counted toward the cap, so an idle daemon's reconnects keep working even when at-capacity.

If the ACP channel initialization budget expires before `newSession` is dispatched, `POST /session` returns `504` with `Retry-After: 5` and:

```json
{
  "error": "AcpSessionBridge initialize timed out after 10000ms",
  "code": "init_timeout",
  "errorKind": "init_timeout",
  "retryable": true,
  "sideEffectPossible": false,
  "phase": "channel.initialize",
  "timeoutMs": 10000
}
```

`timeoutMs` — and the numeric suffix of `error` — reflect the daemon's configured `--initialize-timeout-ms` budget (the values above are the default). The full safe-retry shape above is emitted only for plain session creation, where channel initialization strictly precedes every durable mutation: on that path the `sideEffectPossible: false` field is authoritative because initialization precedes the ACP `newSession` request, and a client that understands this structured contract may retry after the advertised delay without risking a duplicate Session.

Requests carrying `branch` or `worktree`, and initialize timeouts surfaced by mutation-bearing routes other than plain creation (for example `POST /session/:id/branch` and `POST /session/:id/side-task`, where a committed fork can outlive the failed handshake), return the same `504` with `code: "init_timeout"`, `phase`, and `timeoutMs` — but WITHOUT `Retry-After`, `retryable`, or `sideEffectPossible`. For those the mutation outcome is unknown: branch and worktree preparation mutates git before the channel initializes, and the rollback attempted on failure is best-effort (a failed checkout rollback leaves the workspace on the new branch, and a retry may surface a branch-already-exists conflict). Clients that classify all 5xx mutation responses as ambiguous remain conservatively fail-closed, and should apply the same policy to the reduced shape. `POST /session/:id/load` and `POST /session/:id/resume` surface the same reduced `init_timeout` `504` when channel initialization times out before the restore request is dispatched (the `ensureChannel` stage); unlike the `session_restore_timeout` `504` documented in their Errors lists, this shape carries no `Retry-After`, no `retryable`, and installs no fence because the restore was never dispatched. The `newSession` dispatch timeout on `POST /session` is an exception: it returns `504` with `code: "init_timeout"`, `retryable: true`, and a budget-derived `Retry-After`, but without `phase` or `sideEffectPossible`, because the creation outcome is ambiguous. All other timeout labels keep the generic mapping.

`RestoreInProgressError` — emitted by `POST /session/:id/load`, `POST /session/:id/resume`, or a caller-supplied-id `POST /session` when another registration already owns that id — returns `409` and:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is already being restored via session/<resume|load>; retry session/<load|resume> after it completes",
  "code": "restore_in_progress",
  "reason": "restore_in_progress",
  "retryable": true,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "activeAction": "load",
  "requestedAction": "resume"
}
```

Fired when a `session/load` is issued for an id that already has a `session/resume` in flight (or vice versa), or when a caller-supplied-id spawn races either restore direction. Wait at least `Retry-After` seconds and retry. Same-action races (`load` vs `load`, `resume` vs `resume`) coalesce instead of erroring while the restore is active.

`reason` distinguishes two fences that share this code, and the `Retry-After` header tracks it:

| `reason`                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                              | `Retry-After`                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `restore_in_progress`        | An ordinary restore is running.                                                                                                                                                      | `5` (matching `session_limit_exceeded`)                                                                                        |
| `awaiting_abandoned_cleanup` | The public caller already got a timeout (`504` for restore, or `init_timeout` for session initialization) and the non-cancellable ACP request plus its cleanup have not settled yet. | the timed-out operation's budget in seconds — restore, or initialization for a caller-supplied-id spawn — clamped to `5`–`120` |

The public restore request is governed by `limits.sessionRestoreTimeoutMs` (default 60s). After a `504` the id stays fenced until the late ACP request and cleanup settle, so a client that keeps retrying at the ordinary 5-second cadence would spin against a 409 it cannot clear — honor the budget-derived hint that comes with `awaiting_abandoned_cleanup`.

`SessionWorkspaceConflictError` — emitted by `POST /session/:id/load` and `POST /session/:id/resume` when the requested `cwd` targets one registered workspace but the same session id is already live or being restored by another runtime — returns `409` with:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is already live or restoring in another workspace runtime.",
  "code": "session_workspace_conflict",
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/requested/workspace",
  "workspaceId": "requested-workspace-id",
  "liveWorkspaceCwd": "/live/owner/workspace",
  "liveWorkspaceId": "live-owner-workspace-id"
}
```

Clients should retry with the owning workspace or wait for the in-flight restore to finish before restoring the id into a different workspace. Same-workspace restore races continue to use the bridge's `restore_in_progress` / coalescing behavior.

`SessionArchivedError` is emitted when a caller tries to load or resume a session whose JSONL is under `chats/archive/`:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is archived. Unarchive it before loading.",
  "code": "session_archived",
  "sessionId": "<sid>"
}
```

with status `409`.

`SessionArchivingError` is emitted when a session archive or unarchive transition is already in flight for the same id:

```json
{
  "error": "Session \"<sid>\" is being archived or unarchived; retry later.",
  "code": "session_archiving",
  "sessionId": "<sid>"
}
```

with status `409` and `Retry-After: 5`.

## Capabilities

The daemon advertises its supported feature tags from the serve capability
registry. Clients **must** gate UI off `features`, not off `mode` (per design

> Conditional tags appear only when their matching deployment toggle is on (see the table below). F3's `permission_mediation` tag is always-on and carries `modes: ['first-responder', 'designated', 'consensus', 'local-only']` so SDK clients can introspect the build-supported set; the runtime-active strategy is at `body.policy.permission`.

`session_startup_config` advertises optional `startupConfig: { modelServiceId, reasoningEffort? }` on ordinary and standalone creation. Always preflight this tag: older ordinary-create routes may silently ignore the object. `modelServiceId` is required (1–256 characters); `reasoningEffort` accepts `none`, `default`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` when supported by the selected model. Omission applies only the model, without a reasoning setter or implicit `default`. The object cannot be combined with the legacy top-level `modelServiceId` or explicit single scope and implies a new thread. Startup never saves shared defaults; later session behavior is unchanged.

Success includes `modelApplied: true` and `startupConfigApplied: { modelServiceId, reasoningEffort?, effectiveReasoning? }`. The model selector is canonical. Only explicit reasoning requests include the two reasoning fields; effective state is `{ state: 'disabled' }`, `{ state: 'provider-default' }`, or `{ state: 'enabled', effort? }` (toggle-only reasoning has no effort). Invalid structure is `400 invalid_startup_config`; a rejected or unconfirmed selection is `422 startup_config_rejected`. Definite standalone rejection rolls back its owned recording and attempts to discard the empty output directory before returning; a recording rollback whose removal cannot be confirmed and transient startup failures retain `standalone_creation_outcome_unknown`, while a failed directory discard is only logged and the definite rejection is still returned. A success-body confirmation failure in the SDK is a protocol error, not an instruction to adopt a recovered session.

`session_scope_override` is the negotiation handle for the per-request `sessionScope` field on `POST /session` (see below). Older daemons silently ignore the field, so SDK clients should pre-flight `caps.features` for this tag before sending it.

`session_id_override` is the negotiation handle for the optional caller-supplied `sessionId` on `POST /session` and ACP `session/new` metadata. Clients must confirm that `caps.features` contains this tag before sending the field because older daemons may silently ignore it.

`persistent_workspace_registration` advertises durable registration for workspaces added at runtime. `POST /workspaces` accepts `{ "cwd": "/absolute/path", "persist": true }`; success includes `persisted: true`. Registrations are scoped to the daemon's canonical primary workspace under the user's Qwen home and are restored on the next daemon start. Omitting `persist` preserves process-local registration. `GET /workspace-registrations` lists the stored desired set, and `DELETE /workspace-registrations/:id` forgets an entry for the next restart without hot-removing an active runtime.

`workspace_display_name` advertises optional `displayName` input on `POST /workspaces`, workspace metadata updates through `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace`, and optional display-name fields in workspace projections. Names do not participate in lookup or routing: `id` and canonical `cwd` remain the only selectors, and duplicate names are allowed.

`workspace_runtime_removal` advertises synchronous hot removal through `DELETE /workspaces/:workspace`. Capability workspace entries add optional `removable`; only rows with `removable: true` may be removed. Removal also forgets every persistent registration alias for the runtime, but never deletes files, settings, transcripts, or archives.

`workspace_runtime` advertises `GET /workspace/runtime/status`, `POST /workspace/runtime/ensure`, and their `/workspaces/:workspace/runtime/...` equivalents. `ensure` accepts no capability selection: it starts or reuses the selected trusted workspace's ACP runtime and returns its lifecycle state and monotonic runtime epoch. The primary routes are owned only by the primary runtime; qualified routes resolve only the selected registered runtime and never fall back. A successful ensure renews the runtime's ten-minute keepalive window. Status is read-only and never starts the child. Concurrent ensures share one physical startup. Startup in progress or failure returns retryable `503 runtime_still_starting` or `503 runtime_initialization_failed`. Capability preparation may continue after the ensure observation budget expires; in that case ensure still returns the live runtime with a non-ready capability state for status polling. The capability is advertised only when all active runtime bridges provide the authoritative lifecycle snapshot; a selected legacy injected bridge returns `501 workspace_runtime_not_supported` instead of a guessed state or epoch.

`workspace_runtime_stop` independently advertises user-confirmed runtime stopping. `GET /workspaces/runtime-stop-options` is a read-only, process-global preview: it includes committed child count, modeled child ceiling, and each visible workspace's sessions, blocked reasons, channel ID, epoch, current stop token and latest receipt. Ordinary loaded sessions may be explicitly stopped; independent ACP clients, enabled schedules, pending scheduler/management/start work, memory tasks, workers, voice and special-purpose runtimes are blocked. `POST /workspaces/:workspace/runtime/stop` uses the strict mutation gate and only the selected trusted runtime. Send `confirmInterruptions: true`, `expectedChannelId`, `expectedRuntimeEpoch`, `expectedStopToken` and the exact `expectedSessionIds` from the preview. Never fall back to the primary runtime.

A successful response has `state: "stopped"`, `stopped: true` and `released: true`, after acknowledged session closes and the selected child's process-registry release. Registration, files and saved history remain. Responses include affected, interrupted, closed and remaining session IDs. Stale or blocked confirmation is HTTP 409 (`workspace_runtime_stop_stale` / `workspace_runtime_stop_blocked`); partial close is 409 `workspace_runtime_stop_incomplete`; ongoing teardown or failed teardown without proven release is 503 `workspace_runtime_stop_in_progress` / `workspace_runtime_stop_failed`; unsupported management is 501 `workspace_runtime_stop_not_supported`. An unclean teardown that later proves registry release may return 200 with an error warning; unconfirmed session flush still returns a partial/error result. The total observation/close budget is 60 seconds. If it expires while a session close is still in flight, the response settles with `state: "failed"` and `503 workspace_runtime_stop_failed`; cleanup continues separately. The selected workspace stays isolated and its child remains counted until actual cleanup completion, even though the caller has received a failure. Read-only options can later report `stopped` after acknowledged closes and proven release, or `incomplete` when persistence was unconfirmed; the already returned failure snapshot does not change. If the budget is instead exhausted between session closes, the response settles with `state: "incomplete"` and `409 workspace_runtime_stop_incomplete`: no further close or forced kill is started, the stop's admission guard is released (the surviving child remains counted as usual), and stopping the remaining sessions requires a fresh preview and confirmation. A flush refusal is not bypassed by force-killing the remaining sessions. Root exit or a fall in the global process count alone does not establish release of the selected child. On Windows, where the registry does not track descendant process groups, the root's settled exit is the release evidence, so `released: true` does not prove the process tree is gone there.

Repeated confirmation of the latest consumed token observes the same operation. A fresh confirmation can retry an incomplete stop, rotating the token; older consumed tokens then become stale. If a response is lost, read options and match the latest receipt by workspace and stop token instead of stopping another target. Receipts may be unavailable after removal, trust changes, or daemon/bridge recreation; absence leaves the result unknown and never authorizes continuation. SDK `runtimeStopOptions()` and `workspaceById(id).stopRuntime(confirmation)` use REST even with an ACP transport and never automatically repeat the POST. Session subscribers receive `session_closed` with `reason: "client_close"` and `cause: "workspace_runtime_stop"`; fatal stop-associated exits additionally mark `persistenceUnconfirmed: true`. Updated Web Shell clients retain the saved selection/transcript and wait for explicit Resume. This is a one-time stop, not persistent suspension; a client that missed the event may compete for capacity again.

Runtime status and ensure responses use this shape:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/work/project",
  "state": "active",
  "runtimeLive": true,
  "runtimeEpoch": 4,
  "capabilities": {
    "skills": {
      "state": "ready",
      "revision": 2,
      "runtimeEpoch": 4
    }
  }
}
```

`capabilities.skills.state` is `not_started`, `starting`, `ready`, `stale`, or `error`; failures include `{code, message}` in `capabilities.skills.error`. A Skills catalog is current only when the top-level and capability `runtimeEpoch` values match. `revision` orders Skills preparation within one runtime epoch and must not be compared across epochs.

`workspace_skills_config_runtime` advertises the split Skills reads and configuration mutations under `/workspace/{config,runtime}/skills` and `/workspaces/:workspace/{config,runtime}/skills`. The Web Shell uses these routes for Skills management and, while composing a new session, to populate slash commands from config immediately before replacing them with a matching-epoch runtime catalog. When the feature is absent, clients must keep using the legacy Skills routes and must not call runtime ensure solely for Skills.

`session_load` and `session_resume` advertise the explicit-restore routes (`POST /session/:id/load` and `POST /session/:id/resume`). Older daemons return `404` for these paths, so SDK clients should pre-flight `caps.features` before calling. `unstable_session_resume` is still advertised as a deprecated alias for compatibility with SDKs that shipped while the underlying ACP method was named `connection.unstable_resumeSession`; new clients should gate on `session_resume`.

`limits.sessionRestoreTimeoutMs`, when present, is the daemon's wall-clock budget for the underlying ACP `loadSession` / `unstable_resumeSession` request. It is an additive v1 field. The TypeScript SDK gives the daemon 10 seconds of client headroom, and the Web Shell watchdog gives it 15 seconds; clients talking to an older daemon should use 70 seconds and 75 seconds respectively.

`session_transcript` advertises `GET /session/:id/transcript`, a read-only paged replay view over the persisted active-session JSONL. It is separate from `/load`: it does not attach a client, seed the live EventBus, create a live session, or change the live replay window. Clients should use it when they need the complete on-disk transcript for a long session, and continue using `/load` only for bounded live replay during cold UI restore.

`workspace_persisted_transcript` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/transcript`, a daemon-local persisted-only pager that does not start ACP, query live bridge state, load settings, discover project capabilities, or create the legacy persisted cursor key. The tag is unconditional because trusted single-workspace primaries can use the plural route; per-workspace trust authorization is still evaluated on every request. Registered untrusted secondary workspaces may read, while an untrusted primary remains rejected.

`workspace_session_export` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/export`, a trusted-only full export of the selected workspace's active persisted session. It is independent of `session_export` and `workspace_qualified_rest_core`: released daemons can advertise both older tags without implementing the plural route, so clients must pre-flight this tag directly. The tag is unconditional because a trusted single-workspace primary can use the route by id or cwd. The export does not resolve a live owner, start ACP, attach a client, or fall back to another workspace.

`workspace_archived_session_export` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/archive/export`, a trusted-only full export from the selected workspace's archived persisted storage. It is independent of `workspace_session_export` and `workspace_qualified_rest_core`; clients must pre-flight this tag directly. A distinct route prevents an older daemon from ignoring archive intent and returning an active transcript with the same id.

`workspace_session_live_state` advertises `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions/live-state`, a trusted-only, memory-only snapshot of the selected workspace runtime's live sessions plus an in-memory catalog version that tells clients when a full persisted-catalog reload is warranted. It is independent of `workspace_qualified_rest_core`: released daemons can advertise the broader workspace REST capability without implementing this route, so clients must pre-flight this tag directly. The tag is unconditional because a trusted single-workspace primary can use the route by id or cwd; per-workspace trust checks still apply on every request, and the route does not extend the permissive untrusted-secondary persisted-catalog read policy to live bridge state. The tag means the endpoint exists; it does not promise that every live item carries the optional `updatedAt` activity watermark, which is lifecycle-dependent.

The optional top-level `/capabilities` field `sessionLiveStatePollIntervalMs` advertises the daemon-wide live-state polling interval in milliseconds. It is resolved once from the startup environment variable `QWEN_SESSION_LIVE_STATE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, independently of workspace environment overlays. Integer values from `1000` to `2147483647` are accepted; missing or invalid values use `5000`. Web Shell consumes this hint for all workspace live-state polling and also falls back to `5000` for an absent or invalid field from an older or incompatible daemon. This field does not change the route's snapshot semantics, immediate local/visibility refreshes, or full-catalog polling. SDK clients remain responsible for their own timers.

`slow_client_warning` covers SSE backpressure behavior: (a) the daemon emits a `slow_client_warning` synthetic event-stream frame when a subscriber's live frame backlog or live serialized-byte backlog crosses 75% full, once per overflow episode (rearmed after both measurements drain below 37.5%); (b) `GET /session/:id/events` accepts a `?maxQueued=N` query param (range `[16, 2048]`) to pre-size the per-subscriber frame backlog for cold reconnects against a large replay ring. The serialized-byte cap is daemon-owned (default **2 MiB** per subscriber), live-only, and intentionally has no query parameter. The daemon-wide ring size is controlled by `--event-ring-size` (default **8000**, per #3803 §02). Old daemons silently lack the warning/query behavior — pre-flight this tag before opting in.

`typed_event_schema` advertises daemon event payloads that match the SDK's `KnownDaemonEvent` schema. Older daemons may still stream compatible frames, but SDK clients should pre-flight this tag before assuming typed event coverage.

`client_heartbeat` advertises `POST /session/:id/heartbeat`. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before issuing periodic heartbeats.

`session_close` and `session_metadata` advertise `DELETE /session/:id` and `PATCH /session/:id/metadata`. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight these tags before exposing close or rename affordances.

`session_organization` advertises custom session groups and pinning. It adds `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /workspace/:id/session-groups`, `PATCH /session/:id/organization`, and the opt-in organized list view `GET /workspace/:id/sessions?view=organized`. When both `session_organization` and `workspace_qualified_rest_core` are advertised, the workspace-qualified organization mutation `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/organization` is also available. The legacy mutation remains primary-workspace-only. Older daemons return `404` for the mutation/group routes and ignore the organized view contract, so WebShell/SDK clients must pre-flight these tags before showing the matching grouping or pinning UI.

`session_archive` advertises the v1 directory-state archive API: `POST /sessions/archive`, `POST /sessions/unarchive`, and `GET /workspace/:id/sessions?archiveState=active|archived`. Archived sessions cannot be loaded or resumed until they are unarchived. `session_storage_conflict_repair` advertises the additive `resolveConflicts` request option and `resolvedConflicts` response bucket described below.

`workspace_qualified_rest_core` advertises plural core REST routes under `/workspaces/:workspace/...`. The selector resolves as exact workspace id first, then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization. Newer single-workspace daemons include the primary runtime in `workspaces[]` even when `multi_workspace_sessions` is absent, allowing clients to discover the id required by workspace-qualified routes; clients should fall back to `capabilities.workspaceCwd` for older daemons that omit the array. Trust status and trust request routes are available for registered untrusted workspaces; file read routes follow the existing filesystem read policy. Registered untrusted secondary workspaces also expose persisted-only session and session-group catalogs: these reads do not attach to a session, start ACP, or merge live bridge state. File writes, catalog mutations, and other plural core routes require a trusted workspace unless a separate capability explicitly defines a narrower read-only policy, such as `workspace_persisted_transcript`. An untrusted primary continues to receive `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }` from the plural catalog and transcript routes; legacy singular primary routes keep their existing compatibility behavior. This tag covers the core file, status, settings, permissions, trust, lifecycle, MCP control, tool and skill toggles, memory, workspace agent CRUD, and session storage surfaces. It does not cover auth, voice, extensions, ACP/WebSocket transport, channel-worker routing, or workspace-qualified session export; pre-flight `workspace_session_export` or `workspace_archived_session_export` separately. Workspace trust is not an ACL: a client holding the daemon token can read every registered workspace surface allowed by this policy.

`workspace_qualified_voice` advertises Voice routes selected by a trusted workspace runtime: `GET` and `POST /workspaces/:workspace/voice`, `POST /workspaces/:workspace/voice/transcribe`, and `WS /workspaces/:workspace/voice/stream`. It is advertised only when multi-workspace runtimes and the shared ACP/Voice WebSocket listener are both enabled. The selector follows the same id-or-encoded-absolute-cwd rules as other plural routes. For REST, an unknown selector returns `400 { code: "workspace_mismatch" }` and an untrusted selector returns `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }`; WebSocket upgrade rejection exposes the corresponding HTTP 400/403 status without a structured JSON envelope. Neither transport falls back to primary. Legacy `/workspace/voice`, `/workspace/voice/transcribe`, and `/voice/stream` remain primary-only. Clients use `workspace_qualified_voice` for all qualified Voice modalities and let the selected runtime report configuration-specific errors. The legacy `workspace_voice`, `workspace_voice_transcription`, and `voice_transcribe` tags describe only the primary-bound routes and must not hide a qualified secondary configuration.

`workspace_qualified_memory` advertises the workspace-qualified managed-memory routes: `POST /workspaces/:workspace/memory/{remember,forget,dream}` enqueue tasks and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/memory/{remember,forget,dream}/:taskId` reads them back. It is advertised only when ACP HTTP and multi-workspace runtimes are both enabled. The selector follows the same id-or-encoded-absolute-cwd rules as other plural routes. Each registered workspace gets its own task lane; the primary's qualified lane is the same instance as the singular `/workspace/memory` surface, so a task enqueued on one is readable on the other. Resolution is strictly per selected runtime with no primary fallback: an unknown selector returns `400 { code: "workspace_mismatch" }`, an untrusted selector returns `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }`, and an inactive or draining runtime returns `503 { code: "workspace_runtime_unavailable" }`. Reads never allocate a lane, so polling a workspace that has no tasks returns `404 { code: "<kind>_task_not_found" }`. Task ids are scoped to their lane and do not survive a workspace reconfiguration or runtime replacement; a stale id returns `404`, not a data-loss condition. When ACP HTTP is disabled the tag is not advertised and a non-primary qualified request returns a non-retryable `501 { code: "workspace_memory_unavailable" }`, while the primary qualified route keeps working through the locally-owned lane.

`session_lsp` advertises `GET /session/:id/lsp`, the read-only structured LSP status snapshot for daemon clients. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before exposing remote LSP status.

`session_resources` advertises `GET /session/:id/resources`, a read-only pair of sanitized Skill and MCP snapshots built from the selected live session's Config. The route is live-session-owner scoped: it never falls back to the primary runtime and does not infer the session's resources from workspace status. The nested `skills` and `mcp` objects reuse the corresponding workspace status payloads, but omit MCP authentication, pool, workspace-budget, and workspace discovery-error enrichments. Status, discovery, and accounting reported by the selected session's MCP manager remain present. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before showing a session resource catalog.

`session_status` advertises `GET /session/:id/status`, the live bridge summary for a single session by id. In addition to `clientCount` and `hasActivePrompt`, live sessions expose `isWaitingForPermission`, `isWaitingForUserQuestion`, `pendingInteractionCount`, and a retained `turnError` after a failed turn. The error clears when the next prompt actually starts. A live session that has settled a running turn in the current bridge also carries `updatedAt`, the same activity watermark documented under the live-state route; because this route returns the bridge summary directly, the value is not merged with the persisted transcript mtime and may be earlier than the one a session list reports. Both the single-session status response and workspace session lists include `turnError` and `pendingInteractions`: render-ready permission actions or `ask_user_question` questions plus the `requestId` and selectable options required by the existing permission vote routes. Each user question has an `answerKey`; vote with `answers`, for example `{ "0": "Polling" }`, keyed by that value. Persisted-only sessions omit runtime state because no runtime exists. Older daemons return `404`; pre-flight this tag before polling a single session's status instead of scanning the full session list.

`session_info` advertises `GET /workspace/:id/session-info` and its `/workspaces/:workspace/session-info` twin. The response aggregates persisted active and archived session counts without hydrating list metadata. It is an explicit O(n) disk scan and must not be polled; clients should treat `truncated: true` as a lower-bound result.

`session_approval_mode_control`, `workspace_tool_toggle`, `workspace_skill_settings_toggle`, `workspace_skill_settings_batch_toggle`, `extension_batch_activation_v2`, `workspace_init`, and `workspace_mcp_restart` advertise the mutation control routes documented below. Approval-mode control retains its non-strict compatibility gate. The other controls are strict-gated by operator authority: trusted-loopback primary, bearer-authenticated, or paired Local Control requests pass. A token-less primary request that reaches the strict gate without trusted-loopback authority returns 401 `token_required`; missing or invalid configured credentials and unpaired Local Control credentials are rejected earlier by bearer middleware with plain `401 Unauthorized`. Daemons that lack one of these routes return `404`. The settings-specific Skill tags are different: daemons from the retired-tag generation advertise `workspace_skill_toggle` and `workspace_skill_batch_toggle` and serve their catalog-validated contract at the same paths. The retired single-target route can return HTTP `404 skill_not_found` or `409 skill_not_toggleable`; the retired batch route returns HTTP 200 and places catalog-derived failures in `errors[]`. Pre-flight each tag before exposing its affordance, and do not infer the settings-specific Skill contract by probing route reachability. The route paths and request bodies did not change.

`mcp_guardrails` (issue [#4175](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4175) PR 14) covers the MCP budget surface: the `clientCount` / `clientBudget` / `budgetMode` / `budgets[]` fields on `GET /workspace/mcp`, the `disabledReason` field on per-server cells, and the `--mcp-client-budget` / `--mcp-budget-mode` CLI flags. Older daemons omit the new fields entirely; SDK clients pre-flight this tag before relying on `budgets[]` semantics. The registry descriptor also carries `modes: ['warn', 'enforce']` for future feature-modes exposure — for now, clients infer mode from the snapshot's `budgetMode` field. Server refusal under `enforce` mode is deterministic by `Object.entries(mcpServers)` declaration order; a future scope-precedence layer (if qwen-code adopts one) would shift this to "lowest-precedence first" to mirror claude-code's `plugin < user < project < local` convention.

> **Scope is capability-driven.** With `mcp_workspace_pool`, sessions inside one workspace runtime share a transport pool and `WorkspaceMcpBudget`, and the snapshot emits `budgets[0].scope: 'workspace'`. Different workspace runtimes own independent pools. Without the tag, each ACP session uses its legacy `McpClientManager`, the snapshot emits `scope: 'session'`, and N sessions may each consume the configured cap.

`workspace_file_read` covers the text/list/stat/glob workspace file routes
(`GET /file`, `GET /list`, `GET /glob`, `GET /stat`). `workspace_file_bytes`
covers `GET /file/bytes`, which was added later so clients can pre-flight raw
byte-window support against PR19-era daemons. `workspace_file_write` covers
the hash-aware text mutation routes (`POST /file/write`, `POST /file/edit`).
The write tag means the route contract exists; it does not mean the current
deployment is open for anonymous mutation. Write/edit are strict mutation
routes and require operator authority; token-less trusted loopback qualifies.
`workspace_file_upload` covers `POST /file/upload`, the binary ingress route:
an `application/octet-stream` body capped at `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (50 MiB) is
written into the workspace without ever overwriting — an occupied name is
auto-numbered (`name (1).ext`, `name (2).ext`, ...). It is also a strict
mutation route.

When `workspace_qualified_rest_core` is advertised, the same file surface is also available at `/workspaces/:workspace/file`, `/workspaces/:workspace/file/bytes`, `/workspaces/:workspace/stat`, `/workspaces/:workspace/list`, `/workspaces/:workspace/glob`, `/workspaces/:workspace/file/write`, `/workspaces/:workspace/file/edit`, and `/workspaces/:workspace/file/upload`.

The same tag also exposes workspace-qualified project-agent CRUD at `/workspaces/:workspace/agents` and `/workspaces/:workspace/agents/:agentType`. These plural routes only read or mutate project-level agents for the selected workspace; `global` and `user` scope requests return `400 { code: "global_scope_not_supported_for_workspace_route" }`. Workspace-less `/workspace/agents` routes retain their existing primary-workspace behavior and remain the only REST surface for user-level agent scope.

`extension_management_v2` advertises a user-level extension catalog and mutation surface at `/extensions/*`, plus workspace activation projections at `/workspaces/:workspace/extensions/*`. Artifacts are global; workspace routes expose only projection reads, exact activation overrides, and runtime refresh. Reads may target an untrusted registered workspace, while activation, refresh, and workspace-scoped install require a trusted target. Slow mutations use daemon-local operations at `/extensions/operations/:operationId`; store generation, not operation history, is authoritative across restart and across daemons. The published `workspace_extensions` capability and `/workspace/extensions/*` routes remain a primary-workspace compatibility adapter. Clients must preflight `extension_management_v2` and must not infer it from daemon mode or `workspace_qualified_rest_core`.

`extension_git_credentials` advertises authenticated HTTPS Git installs on both `POST /workspace/extensions/install` and `POST /extensions/install`. Clients must preflight this tag before sending URL userinfo or `credentialPersistence`; older daemons reject URL credentials. The tag describes backend protocol support, not the availability of a keychain: stored mode reports the selected backend in the terminal operation result.

`extension_local_path_install` advertises daemon-local Extension sources on both `POST /workspace/extensions/install` and `POST /extensions/install`. The `source` must be an absolute path that exists on the daemon host. Relative paths remain unsupported so daemon process cwd cannot change source identity or shadow a GitHub `owner/repo` shorthand. The existing install operation copies the Extension into managed storage; it does not link the source. Clients must preflight this tag because older daemons reject local sources.

`extension_batch_activation_v2` adds `PUT /extensions/activation` and `PUT /workspaces/:workspace/extensions/activation`. Both accept 1–100 names in `extensionNames`, deduplicate them case-insensitively while preserving first-seen order, persist changed targets in one generation, and return one `202` operation handle. A target does not need to be installed when setting `enabled` or `disabled`: its name creates a desired-state declaration that is preserved when an Extension with that name is installed. The global route accepts `state: "enabled" | "disabled"` and writes V2 `defaultActivation`; the workspace route also accepts `"inherit"` and applies or clears exact overrides for the selected trusted runtime. `inherit` does not declare an unknown name, and an all-unknown clear reports `updated: false`.

`extension_activation_explicit_refresh` means singular and batch activation operations finish after the durable policy commit without directly refreshing active sessions. Callers that need immediate application should wait for activation success and then submit either the synchronous primary-workspace `POST /workspace/extensions/refresh`, which returns refresh counts directly, or the selected workspace's asynchronous `POST /workspaces/:workspace/extensions/refresh`, which returns a separate operation handle. The two forms are not interchangeable: the asynchronous operation records the applied generation when its runtime reconciliation completes, while the synchronous route records nothing, so the generation reconciler still treats that workspace as pending and refreshes its sessions again on its next pass. Callers that can address a specific workspace should prefer the asynchronous form. A refresh failure does not roll back or downgrade the activation result. Daemons without this capability already include runtime refresh in activation, so compatibility clients must not submit a second refresh. The independent 30-second generation reconciler remains enabled and normally applies the committed policy by its next pass; failed reconciliation is retried by later passes.

### Extension Management V2 wire contract

All routes use the daemon bearer authentication rules above. `X-Qwen-Client-Id` is optional for the V2 mutation routes; when supplied, it must identify a client registered with one of the mutation's target workspace runtimes. `:extensionId` is the lowercase 64-hex extension identity. `:workspace` resolves as an exact workspace id first and otherwise as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization.

#### Workspace resource state

Preflight `extension_state` independently. It supports Skills only; it does not imply MCP resource management. Both routes select the registered workspace runtime and never fall back to primary. GET follows the existing read-only trust rules; PUT requires a trusted workspace.

```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "name": "review", "state": "enabled" },
    { "name": "deploy", "state": "disabled" }
  ]
}
```

PUT accepts 1–100 entries, including a single-element batch. It rejects malformed entries, case-insensitive duplicate names and unsupported groups before queuing. All names must belong to the installed target Extension, including currently disabled Skills; an invalid target fails the operation without partial writes. One locked store commit merges the listed overrides for the exact canonical workspace. Unlisted Skills and other workspaces are preserved. There is no settings write, future-name declaration or implicit activation of the parent Extension.

GET returns `v: 1`, `workspaceId`, `workspaceCwd`, `extensionId`, `name` and `skills`. Each Skill has `name`, `defaultEnabled`, nullable `workspaceEnabled`, `effectiveEnabled`, and optional `disabledReason`/`lockedScope`. The manifest's optional `skillStates` supplies defaults; missing values default to enabled. For an active parent, precedence is settings hard disable, settings explicit enable, settings default disable, workspace internal override, manifest default. Internal disablement uses `disabledReason: "default"` and never locks settings. A disabled or removed parent cannot be revived by a Skill override.

The `set_extension_state` operation returns `status: "updated"` with ordered `result.resourceStates.skills`; `result.states` retains its update-check meaning. Persisted state is not proof that every session refreshed. The daemon refreshes only Skills and their commands/model context for the target runtime, including bootstrap and live sessions, without restarting unrelated MCP/LSP/hooks. Post-commit refresh failures produce warnings without rolling back state. Overrides survive restart and Extension updates and are removed on uninstall. Clients must not fall back to the Skill settings API, which writes a higher-priority setting.

#### Global catalog

The global catalog response is:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "generation": 12,
  "extensions": [
    {
      "id": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
      "name": "demo",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "installType": "npm",
      "defaultActivation": "enabled",
      "workspaceOverrideCount": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

`installType` is omitted when no install metadata is available. `defaultActivation` is `enabled` or `disabled`. `workspaceOverrideCount` excludes stored `inherit` entries.

The workspace projection response is:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceId": "workspace-id",
  "workspaceCwd": "/absolute/workspace",
  "trusted": true,
  "desiredGeneration": 12,
  "appliedGeneration": 11,
  "extensions": [
    {
      "extensionId": "<64 lowercase hex characters>",
      "name": "demo",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "defaultActivation": "enabled",
      "workspaceActivation": "disabled",
      "effectiveActivation": "disabled",
      "activationSource": "workspace_override"
    }
  ]
}
```

`workspaceActivation` is `enabled`, `disabled`, or `null` for inheritance. `activationSource` is `default`, `workspace_override`, `legacy_path_rule`, or `cli_override`. `desiredGeneration` is the durable store generation; `appliedGeneration` is the latest generation the controller recorded as applied to that workspace runtime and can temporarily lag.

Install requires explicit consent and an initial activation:

```json
{
  "source": "@scope/demo",
  "consent": true,
  "activation": { "scope": "user" },
  "ref": "optional-git-ref",
  "autoUpdate": true,
  "allowPreRelease": false,
  "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org"
}
```

For workspace-only initial activation use `{ "scope": "workspace", "workspaceId": "target-workspace-id" }`; the target must exist and be trusted. Daemon installs accept GitHub, Git, and npm sources. When `extension_local_path_install` is advertised, they also accept an absolute path that exists on the daemon host. `ref` does not apply to npm, `ref` and `autoUpdate` do not apply to local sources, and `registry` applies only to npm. `ref`, `autoUpdate`, `allowPreRelease`, and `registry` are optional.

When `extension_git_credentials` is advertised, an HTTPS Git source may include userinfo, for example `https://username:token@git.example.com/org/repository.git`. `credentialPersistence` is valid only with such a source. It is `stored` or `one_time` and defaults to `one_time` when omitted. Stored mode saves the credential through the daemon's hybrid secret storage and keeps only the clean repository URL in install metadata, so the extension remains updatable. One-time mode saves neither the repository URL nor the credential and creates a non-updatable `snapshot`; `autoUpdate: true` is rejected for this mode. Supplying the field without URL credentials, supplying invalid credentials, or using credentials with npm, archive, local, SSH, or non-Git sources returns `400`.

Credentialed install responses and operations expose `credentialPersistence` and may expose `credentialStorage` as `keychain` or `encrypted_file`. One-time operations omit `source`; stored operations may return the clean source. Snapshot catalog/status entries omit source, set `credentialPersistence` to `one_time`, and report `not updatable`. Update fails with `extension_not_updatable`; an unavailable stored secret fails before network access with `extension_credential_unavailable`.

Global and workspace activation `PUT` requests use the same body:

```json
{ "state": "enabled" }
```

`state` is `enabled` or `disabled`. Update, uninstall, check-updates, clear-activation, and refresh requests have no required body.

Batch activation requests use Extension names:

```json
{
  "extensionNames": ["formatter", "review-tools"],
  "state": "disabled"
}
```

The workspace batch also accepts `"state": "inherit"`. Terminal global results contain `name` and `defaultActivation`; workspace results contain `name`, `workspaceActivation` (`null` for inherit), and `effectiveActivation`. Malformed names reject the request; conflicts with existing Store identities fail atomically without a partial commit. An unknown `inherit` target is not persisted, because clearing an override must not manufacture a default-activation declaration or replace later install consent.

Every accepted asynchronous mutation returns:

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /extensions/operations/<operation-id>
Retry-After: 1
Content-Type: application/json

{"accepted":true,"operationId":"<operation-id>"}
```

Workspace-qualified mutations use the same global `/extensions/operations/:operationId` polling path. Operation history is process-local, keeps only a bounded number of terminal entries, and is lost on daemon restart; clients must re-read the catalog or workspace projection and compare generations when an operation id disappears.

An operation snapshot has this shape:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "operationId": "<operation-id>",
  "operation": "install",
  "status": "running",
  "phase": "preparing",
  "createdAt": 1750000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1750000000100,
  "source": "owner/repository",
  "name": "demo"
}
```

`status` transitions from `queued` to `running`, then to `succeeded`, `succeeded_with_warnings`, or `failed`. While running, `phase` is `preparing`, `committing`, or `reconciling`. Terminal success may include `result` with `status` equal to `installed`, `enabled`, `disabled`, `updated`, `uninstalled`, `checked`, or `refreshed`; reconciliation results can additionally contain `refreshed`, `failed`, and `error`, while batch activation results contain ordered `results`. Update checks return `result.states`, keyed by extension name, with values such as `checking for updates`, `update available`, `up to date`, `not updatable`, or `error`. Credentials and authorization headers are never operation fields.

A durable commit followed by incomplete cleanup or runtime reconciliation is not reported as a failed mutation. It returns `succeeded_with_warnings` and preserves the committed result:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "operationId": "<operation-id>",
  "operation": "uninstall",
  "status": "succeeded_with_warnings",
  "createdAt": 1750000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1750000000200,
  "result": {
    "status": "uninstalled",
    "name": "demo",
    "refreshed": 2,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "warnings": [
    {
      "workspaceId": "workspace-id",
      "workspaceCwd": "/absolute/workspace",
      "code": "reconcile_slow",
      "error": "Runtime reconciliation took 31000ms."
    }
  ]
}
```

Warning `workspaceId` and `code` are optional; `workspaceCwd` and `error` are always present. Clients should display warnings, refresh their catalog/projection, and must not retry the durable mutation blindly.

Validation and authorization failures are synchronous HTTP errors using `{ "error": "...", "code": "..." }` when a stable code exists. Important cases are `400 invalid_extension_id`, `400 invalid_extension_names`, `400 invalid_extension_name`, `400 invalid_extension_activation`, `400 workspace_mismatch`, `403 untrusted_workspace`, `404 extension_operation_not_found`, and `429 extension_queue_full`. Install validation also returns `400` for invalid source/ref/registry options, missing consent, or missing/invalid initial activation. A mutation that fails after `202` is represented, while retained in operation history, with `status: "failed"`, `error`, and an optional stable `code`; common codes include `extension_prepare_timeout` and `extension_conflict`. HTTP `404` for an operation does not imply rollback because operation history is not durable.

`daemon_status` advertises `GET /daemon/status`, the consolidated read-only
operator diagnostic snapshot documented below.

`daemon_update` advertises the process-global `GET /daemon/update`,
`POST /daemon/update/prepare`, and `POST /daemon/update/restart` surface.

**Conditional tags.** These feature tags are advertised only when their deployment toggle, runtime wiring, or availability condition is active. Tag presence means the documented behavior is available; absence means either an older daemon predating the tag or a current daemon where that condition is false. Currently:

Earlier permission/hook denials make no provider request. Nested AgentCore execution is outside v1 and is rejected while this external provider mode is active. The tag reflects only the external provider: independently of it, every daemon applies the built-in Git relocation guard to the managed tools that carry a shell command line (`run_shell_command` and `monitor`), so the absence of this tag does not mean no pre-execution denials. |

<!-- conditional-serve-features:end -->

Live Voice uses the Web Shell endpoint (`realtime_voice_web`, WS `/live/web`) on every platform by default. The native macOS Host is opt-in: only a macOS daemon started with `QWEN_SERVE_LIVE_NATIVE_HOST=1` advertises `realtime_voice`, registers WS `/live/host` and installs the Host when Live is enabled. Without it, `/live/setup` reports `nativeHost: false` with a non-retryable `install` error, and `POST /live/setup/install` and `POST /live/setup/launch` answer `409 live_native_host_unavailable`.

A browser Host answers `host.capture_visual` only while the user is sharing a
screen with the page, which the page reports in its hello as
`selfChecks.screenShare`. Sharing is a separate, explicit act — the model asks
mid-turn, and `getDisplayMedia` needs a user gesture — so the page holds the
stream and takes one frame per request. With nothing shared it answers
`success: false` immediately rather than letting the request time out.

Because a page cannot write to the daemon's filesystem, it sends only the JPEG.
The daemon ignores any `screenshotPath` a browser lease reports and stores the
image itself, under a name it chooses, in the same private capture directory a
native Host writes to. A native Host still persists its own PNG and passes the
path, as before.

`mcp_guardrails` is **not** in this conditional table — it's an always-on tag, advertised whenever the binary supports the new `/workspace/mcp` budget fields, regardless of whether the operator configured a budget. Operators who haven't set `--mcp-client-budget` still get the new fields (with `budgetMode: 'off'`, `budgets: []`).

`mcp_guardrail_events` (issue [#4175](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4175) PR 14b) advertises the typed SSE push events that surface MCP budget state crossings without a poll loop. Two frame types arrive on `GET /session/:id/events`:

- `mcp_budget_warning` — fires once on the upward 75% crossing of `reservedSlots.size / clientBudget`. Re-arms only after the ratio drops below 37.5% (`MCP_BUDGET_REARM_FRACTION`). Mirrors PR 10's `slow_client_warning` hysteresis, but at the manager level rather than the per-subscriber backlog level. Payload: `{ liveCount, reservedCount, budget, thresholdRatio: 0.75, mode: 'warn' | 'enforce' }`. Fires under both `warn` and `enforce` modes; never under `off`.
- `mcp_child_refused_batch` — fires at end of each `discoverAllMcpTools*` pass when one or more servers were refused, AND as a length-1 batch on the `readResource` lazy-spawn refusal path. Payload: `{ refusedServers: [{ name, transport, reason: 'budget_exhausted' }, ...], budget, liveCount, reservedCount, mode: 'enforce' }`. `mode` is the literal `'enforce'` because `warn` mode never refuses.

Both events live in the per-session SSE replay ring (they carry an `id`) so a client reconnecting with `Last-Event-ID` resumes through them; the snapshot at `GET /workspace/mcp` is still the source-of-truth for state-after-extended-disconnect. Always-on once advertised — there is no conditional toggle. SDK reducer state (`DaemonSessionViewState`) exposes `mcpBudgetWarningCount`, `lastMcpBudgetWarning`, `mcpChildRefusedBatchCount`, `lastMcpChildRefusedBatch` for adapters that want simple lag-style UI.

## Routes

Clients can feature-detect `session_turn_status` and poll `GET /session/:id/turns/current` or `GET /session/:id/turns/:promptId`. These routes require the live owning Session and never load or scan another workspace. Settled results are best-effort transcript records read from the active branch with a bounded scan; `prompt_not_found` means no result was found in the live queue, 64-entry terminal overlay, or bounded active window. `resultText` is the raw final parent-model answer after the last tool boundary, before optional message rewriting, and may be absent. Results over 32,768 UTF-16 code units include `resultTruncated: true` and `resultCode: "RESULT_TEXT_TRUNCATED"`.

### `GET /health`

Liveness probe. Default form returns `200 {"status":"ok"}` if the listener is up — cheap, no bridge access, suitable for high-frequency k8s/Compose liveness probes.

Pass `?deep=1` (also accepts `?deep=true` or bare `?deep`) for a daemon-wide probe that aggregates bridge **counters** across every managed workspace runtime, including a workspace that is still draining (informational only, not a true liveness check):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "workspaceCount": 2,
  "sessions": 3,
  "pendingPermissions": 1,
  "activePrompts": 1,
  "activeWork": true,

`sessions`, `pendingPermissions`, and `activePrompts` are sums. `activeWork` is true when any runtime has an accepted but unsettled prompt (including a FIFO-waiting prompt), a running background Agent, a queued/in-progress Agent terminal notification, Session-managed background shell or workflow work, or a child-owned Session turn. The aggregate `session` hold covers goal and cron processing, history mutation, and queued or running Monitor continuations; foreground prompts remain daemon-owned. Running Monitors, follow-up suggestions, and external processes the shell registry can no longer track remain outside the field. It is session-scoped: channel-level work with no session attached yet — a spawn in flight, a pending restore, MCP discovery or authentication — is not counted, so `activeWork` may read false while the daemon still declines to reclaim that channel. Do not read this field as "the daemon is reclaimable"; it describes session-owned work only. `activeWorkReporting` says how much of that boolean is actually vouched for: `full` when every live session is covered by a fresh report from a child that reports all required categories, `none` when no session negotiated reporting, and `partial` for anything between — including a stale snapshot or a negotiated child that omits a required category. A snapshot older than three report intervals stops counting as coverage: it is not a report that the session is idle, so the session goes back to reading as retained, exactly as if the child had never reported. Ordinary automatic cleanup is also disabled for a negotiated-but-incomplete child; a child that does not understand `shell` or `session` cannot safely authorize conditional close according to the complete current predicate. Completely unsupported historical children retain legacy cleanup behavior, and explicit close, kill, shutdown, and channel exit remain force operations. `activeWorkStaleMs` is the age of the oldest snapshot the boolean rests on **among the covered sessions**, and is `0` when no session is covered; it is diagnostic, because freshness is already graded into `activeWorkReporting` by the daemon (only the daemon knows each channel's negotiated cadence). The grade is computed once over every managed runtime rather than per runtime and then combined — a runtime with no sessions is vacuously complete, and treating that as evidence would let an empty workspace vouch for another workspace's unreported sessions. `lastActivityAt` is the latest non-null workspace activity time and `idleSinceMs` is derived from that same snapshot. `channelAlive` means at least one managed workspace channel is live; it does not mean every workspace is healthy. `connectedClients` and the optional `rateLimitHits` remain daemon-wide counters rather than per-workspace sums.

Restart controllers should treat the daemon as busy when:

```ts
const busy =
  health.activePrompts > 0 ||
  health.activeWork ||
  health.activeWorkReporting !== 'full';
```

Dropping the third term makes `activeWork === false` indistinguishable from "no child told me anything", which is the one case where acting on it is unsafe. Unknown responses and failed probes must also prevent restart. `activePrompts` remains an independent compatibility signal.

These fields are an observation cache, not a restart lease: even a fresh, fully-graded, empty answer describes the moment it was sampled, and work can start immediately afterwards. The rule above lowers the risk of a wrong restart substantially but does not eliminate it — strict safety needs a prepare-restart fence that stops new work admission, confirms the drain, and only then shuts down.

> ⚠️ The deep probe is **informational**, not a real liveness verification or an atomic reclaim lease. Negotiated ACP children publish channel-wide active-work snapshots on a negotiated cadence, and the daemon grades their freshness into `activeWorkReporting` — but it never kills a channel over a missing report, because one session's silence is not evidence the process died. Transport liveness and stalled-Agent detection are separate mechanisms. `connectedClients` counts REST SSE connections, not every ACP transport. Use repeated samples and graceful shutdown for idle reclamation; use authenticated `/daemon/status` for transport and per-workspace diagnostics. If any managed runtime getter throws, deep health fails closed with `503 {"status":"degraded","reason":"aggregation_failed"}` rather than returning partial totals, and the daemon log identifies the failing workspace runtime. During bootstrap, before the runtime registry is ready, it returns `503 {"status":"degraded","reason":"bootstrap"}` with `Retry-After: 1`. For listener liveness, use the default `/health` without `?deep`.

**Auth:** required on non-loopback binds and when loopback is hardened with `--require-auth`. On an ordinary loopback bind (`127.0.0.0/8`, `localhost`, `::1`, `[::1]`), `/health` is registered before the bearer middleware so k8s/Compose probes inside the pod don't need to carry the token. On non-loopback (`--hostname 0.0.0.0` etc.) or hardened loopback, the route is registered after the bearer middleware and returns 401 without a valid token — otherwise an unauthenticated caller could probe arbitrary addresses to confirm a `qwen serve` exists, a low-severity info leak that combines poorly with port scanning. CORS deny + Host allowlist still apply on the ordinary-loopback exemption.

### `GET /daemon/update`, `POST /daemon/update/prepare`, and `POST /daemon/update/restart`

These authenticated routes manage the daemon's Qwen Code installation,
independent of the selected workspace. They always use REST, including from SDK
clients with an ACP session transport. The `daemon_update` capability advertises
the protocol; availability is determined by the returned state.

GET checks for releases without downloading or activating them. Successful
checks are cached for 15 minutes and errors for one minute; `?refresh=true`
requests a fresh check. Concurrent checks share one lookup. The response contains
`state` (`available`, `up-to-date`, `installing`, `ready`, `restarting`,
`unavailable`, or `error`), `canInstall`, optional `currentVersion` and
`latestVersion`, and optional `instructions` and `message`. `currentVersion`
identifies the running daemon, including after an update is prepared. Unsupported
installation methods can report `available` with `canInstall: false` and manual
instructions.

Automatic updates require a real CLI lifecycle with POSIX `process.execve`, a
standalone or managed global npm installation, and operator settings that permit
`general.enableAutoUpdate`. Embedded servers, Windows, unsupported Node runtimes,
and development mode report `unavailable`. Only global/system settings apply;
workspace settings cannot enable installation. The connection must use the
primary listener and its daemon runtime token, or the explicitly trusted
loopback deployment without a token. Paired browsers and Local Control connections
report `unavailable`, because their credentials or listener would not survive
restart; their update mutations return `403 update_connection_unsupported`.

Both POST routes require the strict mutation gate's daemon operator authority
and accept no parameters. The server chooses the release, destination, and
launcher; clients cannot supply a version or command.

- `POST /daemon/update/prepare` starts a background download and returns `202`
  with `state: "installing"`. It does not change the active installation. Poll GET
  until the state is `ready`; repeated preparations share the same operation and
  a prepared update returns `200`. With no automatic update available it returns
  `409 update_unavailable`.
- `POST /daemon/update/restart` requires a prepared update, otherwise it returns
  `409 update_not_ready`. It responds with `202` and `state: "restarting"` before
  activating the update, gracefully closing the daemon, and replacing the process
  with the updated launcher. Repeated clicks share one restart. The replacement
  preserves PID, working directory, CLI options, bound port, and effective daemon
  token, clears old version pins, and does not reopen a browser. The client polls
  GET until `currentVersion` changes, then reloads the document at the URL
  captured when the update was requested. Standalone launcher validation runs before closing
  services; a failed check leaves the daemon running. Failures after shutdown
  begins or during process replacement are not guaranteed to recover.

Web Shell automatically checks and prepares available supported updates in the
background, and displays its version-adjacent update button only when ready.
Preparation and readiness survive workspace runtime reloads. Ordinary daemon
shutdown discards the prepared download. Activation failures keep the daemon
running and report `error`; the next check after the one-minute error cache can
prepare a new download for retry. Disabling automatic updates removes readiness
and cleans the download before a restart can begin. Clicking the update button
explicitly restarts the entire daemon and interrupts its active sessions.

### `GET /daemon/status`

Read-only operator diagnostics. Unlike `/health`, this is a normal daemon API:
it is registered after bearer auth and rate limiting, including on loopback
binds. Query parameter:

- `detail=summary` (default) reads only in-memory daemon state.
- `detail=full` also includes live session diagnostics, ACP connection
  diagnostics, auth device-flow counts, and workspace status sections.
- any other `detail` returns `400 { "code": "invalid_detail" }`.

`summary` intentionally does not query workspace status methods, start an ACP
child, or spawn a session. `full` queries each workspace section independently;
a timeout or exception marks only that section as `unavailable` and adds a
`workspace_status_unavailable` issue.

Multi-workspace responses also include top-level `workspaces[]` rows with
`{ id, cwd, displayName?, primary, trusted }`. The optional display name is
omitted when unset and remains presentation-only; status consumers must keep
using `id` or `cwd` to correlate runtimes.

`runtime.perf` is optional. When present, it reports daemon-process event loop
lag, prompt FIFO queue wait samples, and daemon-child pipe byte counters only;
ACP child event loop lag is not included in `/daemon/status`.

`status` is `error` if any issue has error severity, `warning` if any issue has
warning severity, otherwise `ok`. Issue codes are stable and include
`session_capacity_high`, `connection_capacity_high`, `pending_permissions`,
`acp_channel_down`, `preflight_error`, `mcp_budget_warning`,
`mcp_budget_exhausted`, `rate_limit_hits`, `channel_worker_exited`,
`channel_worker_partial_connect`, `channel_restore_failed`, and
`workspace_status_unavailable`. During
the short window after the listener is ready but before the full runtime is
mounted, `/daemon/status` may report `daemon_runtime_starting`; if the async
runtime mount fails, it reports `daemon_runtime_failed` while non-status
runtime routes return `503`.

`runtime.activity` reports daemon-wide prompt activity. `activePrompts` counts sessions with an in-flight prompt. `pendingPrompts` counts all accepted prompts that have not settled yet, including the running prompt and FIFO-waiting prompts. `queuedPrompts` counts FIFO-waiting prompts that have been accepted but not dispatched. `lastActivityAt` is the ISO 8601 timestamp of the last prompt start/end or session spawn; `null` when the daemon has never processed any activity since boot. `idleSinceMs` is computed from `lastActivityAt` at response generation time.

`limits.memory` is additive and reports the daemon's resolved memory figures: a required `enforced: false`, a `childHeap` object (`mode`: `off`, `observe`, or `admit`; `admissionEnforced`, true only for managed `admit`; `maxConcurrentChildren` and `perChildCeilingMb`, both `null` under `mode: 'off'`, which models nothing — and `perChildCeilingMb` additionally `null` wherever no partition can be modeled within `modeled.minChildHeapMb` — either the pool cannot cover one child at that floor, or the ceiling would land under it once capped at `modeled.legacyChildCeilingMb`, which is `floor(available / 2)` and so drops under the floor on a host below 1024 MB. It is never 0, and `maxConcurrentChildren` is `0` in those cases, since a host that models no partition is a computed answer rather than an absent model; and `refusals`, the spawns that would have exceeded the modeled limit), `configuredBudgetMb`, `effectiveBudgetMb` (the configured value capped at resolved cgroup/host memory), `budgetSource` (`flag` / `derived`), `availableMemoryMb`, `availableMemorySource` (`constrained` / `host`), `insufficientMemory`, and a `modeled` object holding `rootReserveMb`, `childPoolMb`, `minChildHeapMb`, `maxChildHeapMb`, and `legacyChildCeilingMb` (a conservative model of the ceiling an ACP child receives today, which can sit below the real figure). `runtime.memory` additionally reports `registeredWorkspaces` (the registration count — non-removed workspace entries, including draining, transitioning, or blocked ones; not a live-child count), `activeAcpChildren` (daemon-managed ACP children with a live, non-dying channel — includes transitioning or blocked entries, but excludes a workspace whose kill has started even if the child has not exited; not channel workers, MCP descendants, or unattached spawn reservations), `childRssCoverage` (`active_children` — every ACP child with a live channel, which is the set `activeAcpChildren` counts; older daemons send `primary_only`), a `children` object described below, and a `modeled` object holding `recommendedShareAtRegisteredMb` (`null` when no workspace is registered) and `recommendedShareAtActiveMb` (`null` when no child is active). Each share is capped at the legacy child ceiling, and floored at the minimum child heap only when the ceiling allows — on a small host the ceiling sits below the floor, so share × count can exceed the child pool. Read a share as advisory, not a partition of the pool. Child heap sizing remains advisory: no child spawn argument derives from these values. Opt-in `admit` enforces the modeled concurrent child count, while the default `observe` only records would-be refusals. `runtime.memory.committedAcpChildren` counts managed ACP reservations and attached children, including terminating children until registry release; it is `null` when the managed registry is unavailable. `childHeap` models a fixed partition of `modeled.childPoolMb` — every child would receive the same `perChildCeilingMb`, so the modeled total stays inside the pool rather than accumulating as a per-spawn share would. Read `refusals` as admission pressure only: a count of 0 does **not** mean the partition is safe to apply, because children run on the much larger host-derived ceiling, so a workload needing more old space than `perChildCeilingMb` is healthy here and would only fail once the partition were applied. Two further reasons a nonzero count need not mean capacity pressure: the admission decision counts a terminating child until it exits, so on a daemon already at `maxConcurrentChildren` every channel replacement books a refusal during the overlap window; and on a host too small to model a partition `maxConcurrentChildren` is `0`, so `refusals` equals the total ACP spawn count, with `insufficientMemory` as the field that explains it. In `admit`, a zero-slot model fails startup. A fully managed daemon facing capacity exhaustion may reclaim one least-recently-used empty ACP with no live sessions or pending work, wait for tracked release, then retry admission once before spawning. Loaded sessions remain protected; workspace registration and saved history are retained. The `refusals` counter counts rejected admission attempts, including an initial rejection followed by successful reclamation, not final user-visible failures. Exhausted capacity returns REST HTTP 503 with `code: "acp_child_capacity_exhausted"`, `maxConcurrentChildren`, and `committedAcpChildren` (excluding the rejected reservation), without `Retry-After`. ACP JSON-RPC uses `-32603` with `data.errorKind` carrying that code, `data.httpStatus: 503`, and the same counters. A verified pre-dispatch standalone creation rollback retains `standalone_creation_rolled_back`, its session ID and retryability, and nests the capacity code and counters under `capacity`; uncertain creation outcomes retain their existing recovery semantics. Clients should stop automatic capacity retries and preserve the draft or selected session for manual retry. On the normal `runQwenServe` path the budget is resolved before the bootstrap app is created, so `limits.memory` is already populated during the bootstrap window. It is `null` only on paths that resolve no budget (such as direct-embed bypassing `runQwenServeImpl`). The SDK type allows `null`, so correct clients cope.

`runtime.memory.children` is additive within that block and reports aggregate RSS across the children `childRssCoverage` names: `rssBytes` (their summed self-reported RSS), `sampled` (how many produced a reading), and `oldestReadingAgeMs` (the age of the oldest reading in the sum, so a caller can tell how far apart its parts were taken). The denominator for `sampled` is the sibling `activeAcpChildren`, not repeated inside the block; when `sampled` is lower, `rssBytes` is a floor rather than a total. Sampling is gated on an active SSE/WS watcher, so a status request against a daemon nobody is streaming from reports `sampled: 0` even with live children — `activeAcpChildren` beside it makes that gap visible, and `rssBytes: 0` with `sampled: 0` never means a measured zero. `oldestReadingAgeMs` is `null` when nothing was sampled and also when every contributor is a bridge predating the field, so it never means "fresh". Read the sum as an over-count and an under-count at once: summing per-process RSS double-counts pages the children share, while each child reports only its own process, so its MCP descendants and every channel worker are missing. It is not the daemon tree's memory. The field is optional in the SDK mirror because daemons reporting `primary_only` never send it.

`runtime.memory.children.heap` is additive within that block and reports each ACP child's lifetime V8 old-generation high-water marks, aggregated as a **maximum, not a sum**: `peakOldGenerationBytes`, `peakLiveSetBytes`, `peakTotalHeapBytes`, `majorGcCount`, `majorGcMs`, `unclassifiedSpaceNames`, and `reported`. A heap ceiling applies per child and the peaks were reached at different times, so a total would answer no question; each field is an independent maximum across the reporting children, not a portrait of one child, and a per-child ceiling is judged against each axis on its own. `reported` counts how many of `sampled` contributed, and is lower when some children predate the fields. Every byte figure covers the **old generation** — what `--max-old-space-size` actually bounds — and not `old_space` alone, because a child can exhaust its ceiling with `old_space` at a few megabytes while `large_object_space` holds everything. `peakOldGenerationBytes` is committed bytes and rises with the ceiling the child was given, so read it as an upper bound on what the workload needs rather than as its requirement; `peakLiveSetBytes` is what survives a major GC and does not move with the ceiling, which is what makes it the figure able to say a child cannot fit one; read it as an upper bound rather than an exact live set, because GC entries arrive asynchronously and anything allocated between the collection and the read is counted. `peakLiveSetBytes` is `0` until a major GC is observed, which is an absence rather than a measurement. `unclassifiedSpaceNames` is the union of heap spaces no reporting child could classify; V8 renames and adds spaces between versions, an unknown space is dropped from the sums, and dropping under-counts — so a non-empty array means the byte figures are incomplete and must not be read as a full measurement. The whole object is `null`, never a zeroed object, when no sampled child reported one; with no SSE/WS watcher attached nothing is sampled at all, so that is a routine state rather than an edge case. All of it is observational: nothing here sizes a child, refuses a spawn, or moves `limits.memory.enforced` off `false`.

`runtime.memory.pressure` is additive within that block and reports the daemon root's own memory pressure: `mode` (`off` / `observe`), `level` (`normal` / `soft` / `hard` / `critical`), `source` (`rss` / `heap` / `unknown`), `ratio`, and the six raw figures the ratios come from — `rssBytes`, `rssRatio`, `availableBytes`, `heapUsedBytes`, `heapRatio`, `heapLimitBytes`. `ratio` is the larger of `rssRatio` and `heapRatio`, and `source` names which one it was; ties are reported as `rss`. `availableBytes` is `limits.memory.availableMemoryMb` in bytes — deliberately the detected cgroup/host figure rather than `effectiveBudgetMb`, because what ends the process is the real limit, not an operator's policy number. `source: "unknown"` means neither denominator was measurable and must not be read as healthy; `level` is `normal` in that case only because there is nothing to classify. The figures cover the daemon **root process only**: they are this process's own `memoryUsage()`, so children growing does not move them. `runtime.memory.children` reports those separately, and neither figure is process-tree memory. Both modes report the whole block; only `observe` additionally raises the path-free `daemon_memory_pressure` warning into the status rollup, so `off` leaves the top-level `status` unchanged. Nothing remediates in either mode. The field is optional in the SDK mirror because daemons that shipped `runtime.memory` before it exists send the block without it.

`limits.maxRegisteredWorkspaces` is additive and reports the resolved user registration cap (default 256, configurable from 1 through 256). `limits.maxChannelControlWorkspaces` reports the independent control/recovery owner cap of 25 on the standard daemon, even while channels are disabled. Custom controllers advertise that field only when they enforce it. These fields are present on both bootstrap and ready responses; older daemons may omit them. The channel controller rejects transitional owner unions over its cap with `409 channel_control_workspace_limit_reached` before constructing candidate workers; an initial boot-time union over the cap fails startup before the listener is published, so it has no HTTP surface. Registration capacity does not determine the SDK channel timeout.

`limits.maxTotalSessions` is additive. `null` means the effective daemon-wide fresh-session cap is disabled. When the resolved registration capacity (default 256, configurable through `QWEN_SERVE_MAX_WORKSPACES` or embedded `maxRegisteredWorkspaces`) exceeds 25 and `--max-total-sessions` is omitted, the standard daemon uses a fixed total of 800, even with one startup workspace. At registration capacities of 25 or less, several startup/restored workspaces with a finite `maxSessionsPerWorkspace` derive the effective total once as `maxSessionsPerWorkspace * workspaceCount` over that same startup-plus-restored count; one startup or restored workspace retains an unlimited default. Explicit total limits, including disabled values, take precedence. Later dynamic registration does not recompute the total. Direct `createServeApp` embeds must supply their own shared admission policy. When set, it limits fresh session creation across the daemon and reports total-limit failures with the existing `session_limit_exceeded` error shape plus `scope: "total"`.

`runtime.channel.live` reports the ACP bridge channel inside the daemon. It is
not the channel-adapter worker. Daemon-managed channels use
`runtime.channelWorker`, whose `state` is one of `disabled`, `starting`,
`running`, `exited`, `failed`, or `stopped`. When a worker reaches `running`
and then exits, `/daemon/status` keeps the daemon online and reports warning
issue code `channel_worker_exited`.

Daemon-managed channel worker startup from an explicit `qwen serve --channel
...` remains fail-fast and takes precedence over persisted startup settings.
A flagless boot restores `serve.channels` from every trusted registered
workspace, each contributing the list in its own workspace-scope settings. The
restored names form one selection whose owners are resolved as usual, with the
workspace that listed a name breaking an otherwise ambiguous ownership tie.
That boot attribution lasts as long as the daemon runs: a `PUT
/workspace/channel` re-enabling such a name resolves it the way boot did, even
after the selection was stopped in between. A name a non-primary workspace
contributed is dropped, with a log identifying it, when it cannot be resolved,
so one workspace's stale entry does not strand the others; a name the primary
workspace listed still fails the restore as a whole, whether or not another
workspace lists it too.
`all` remains primary-only: it is ignored, and reported, anywhere else.

A trusted non-primary workspace registered after boot restores its own
`serve.channels` too, loading the channel runtime and reserving the
channel-service lease if nothing else has. That restore:

- happens **once per daemon run** — recorded as soon as the workspace asks for
  anything — so a later removal and re-registration, or a trust
  re-materialization, does not undo an operator who stopped one of those
  channels in between;
- does not happen under an explicit `--channel` selection, which no workspace
  registered later extends;
- does not happen after `DELETE /workspace/channel` stopped hosting, until a
  `PUT /workspace/channel` commits a selection again or the daemon restarts;
- leaves a committed `all` selection as it is;
- adds that workspace's names to the committed selection in one change, one
  late restore at a time. Unlike boot, which drops a name it cannot host and
  keeps the rest, a name that cannot be attributed leaves that workspace's
  whole list unrestored, with the error logged and reported as described
  below.

Registration does not wait on channel control at all. The restore is queued
on the channel-control lane and the response is written without waiting for
it, and so is the reconcile a registration or trust change triggers for
channels the daemon already hosts. A worker that never becomes ready therefore
delays only the channel work queued behind it, never another registration or a
trust reconcile. The flip side is that a `201` from `POST /workspaces` does not
mean that workspace's channels are up, or that an already-hosted channel it
owns has finished restarting; read `GET /workspace/channel` for that.

Without an explicit selection, a boot-time `serve.channels` restore, or a
registration like the one above, channel runtime loading stays lazy.

Stored startup names must be non-empty, have no leading or trailing whitespace,
and contain no unsafe control or invisible characters. Invalid entries are
skipped individually and logged by array index; startup does not trim them into
other instance names or rewrite settings. Worker arguments use
`--channel=<value>`, preserving a leading dash as part of the name.

An invalid startup field or a validation or lease error before workers start
skips the automatic restore, with a log identifying `serve.channels`, while
unrelated settings remain in effect. A failed worker startup allows the daemon
to continue after cleanup succeeds. Global runtime startup timeouts and
unconfirmed worker stops follow the existing startup-failure path; the lease
remains held while worker termination is unconfirmed. Channel management
reports persisted startup settings and actual runtime state.

Some `serve.channels` names the daemon did not bring up are reported rather
than only logged. Such a name never joins the committed selection, so no
worker snapshot carries it. Three cases are reported:

- a configured startup selection whose worker failed to start, on the boot
  path that keeps the daemon serving without its channels;
- a name the boot ownership resolver dropped while attributing it to a
  workspace, reported against every workspace that listed it;
- every name still unhosted after a late registration's restore failed.

They surface in two places:

- `/daemon/status` reports one `channel_restore_failed` warning per workspace,
  naming each channel with its error. This is the complete surface, and it is
  present on the bootstrap response as well, which is the only one that exists
  while boot records are being written. At most 64 channels are named per
  workspace, each name bounded to 128 characters, with `and <n> more` when the
  list is longer;
- that workspace's `GET /workspaces/:workspace/channels` lists the channel with
  `runtime: { state: "error", lastError }` instead of `stopped`, where
  `lastError` is the adapter's own startup error when the worker reported one
  for that channel, otherwise the attempt's error. This surface is built from
  the workspace's own channel settings scope, so it can only carry a name that
  scope defines — a name no registered workspace configures, or one whose
  config lives in another workspace, has no row here and is reported on
  `/daemon/status` alone.

Everything else that leaves a `serve.channels` name unhosted is diagnosed in
the daemon log only: a name lost because the whole list was unreadable or
invalid, a non-primary workspace's list discarded because the primary selected
`all`, a late restore skipped because the committed selection is `all`, and a
remote (SSH) workspace's list. Inspect daemon logs for those.

A report lasts until the channel is hosted — by this workspace or by a later
restore from another one — until its workspace is no longer registered, or
until an operator acts: `POST` start, stop or restart on the channel,
`PUT`/`DELETE /workspace/channels/:name`, or a `PUT`/`DELETE
/workspace/channel` that changes the selection. `PUT
/workspace/channels/:name/startup` does not clear it: it rewrites
`serve.channels` without saying anything about the attempt that failed. The
report is kept in memory: a restarted daemon restores again and reports what
that attempt did. The error text is credential-redacted and bounded the way
the daemon log renders it.

After a worker has reached ready, unexpected exits are restarted by the serve
supervisor within a bounded policy: up to 3 restart attempts in a 5 minute
window, with 1s, 5s, then 15s backoff. The worker sends IPC heartbeats every
15s; if no heartbeat is observed for 45s, the supervisor treats the worker as
stale, kills it, records `staleHeartbeatAt`, and uses the same restart path.

`runtime.channelWorker` may include additive operational fields:
`requestedChannels`, `pid`, `startedAt`, `exitCode`, `signal`, `error`,
`restartCount`, `lastExitAt`, `lastRestartAt`, `nextRestartAt`,
`lastHeartbeatAt`, `staleHeartbeatAt`, `startupFailures`, and
`startupFailuresTruncated`. Each startup failure has `channel`, `phase`
(currently `connect`), optional adapter-provided `code`, and a credential-
redacted `message`. At most 64 failures are retained for the current worker
generation; the truncation flag means more failures were observed. `code` is
diagnostic and is not a stable cross-adapter classification. `restartCount` is the lifetime
number of restart attempts made by this serve process; a running worker with
`restartCount > 0` is healthy unless another issue applies. A running worker
whose `requestedChannels` include names missing from `channels` reports
`channel_worker_partial_connect`.

On a multi-workspace daemon (`--workspace` repeated), `runtime` additionally
includes `channelWorkers[]` — one entry per owning workspace, each a
`channelWorker` snapshot annotated with `workspaceId`, `workspaceCwd`, and
`primary`. `channelWorker` stays populated as the primary workspace's snapshot
for compatibility. Single-workspace daemons omit `channelWorkers[]`.

### Daemon-managed channel control

The `channel_control` capability advertises the runtime selection resource.
The resource is daemon-wide even though its compatibility path uses the
singular `/workspace` prefix. Runtime selections are not persisted and do not
modify the daemon's boot-time `--channel` option.

`GET /workspace/channel` returns an immutable manager snapshot:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "selection": { "mode": "names", "names": ["telegram", "feishu"] },
  "pendingSelection": { "mode": "names", "names": ["telegram"] },
  "transition": "reconciling",
  "workers": [
    {
      "workspaceId": "primary-id",
      "workspaceCwd": "/work/primary",
      "primary": true,
      "enabled": true,
      "state": "running",
      "channels": ["telegram"],
      "pid": 1234
    }
  ]
}
```

`selection` is `null` while disabled. `pendingSelection` is present only during
a mutation. `transition` is one of `idle`, `starting`, `reconciling`,
`stopping`, or `rolling_back`.

`PUT /workspace/channel` is strict-gated and accepts exactly one selection:

```json
{ "selection": { "mode": "all" } }
```

```json
{ "selection": { "mode": "names", "names": ["telegram", "feishu"] } }
```

Names are trimmed and deduplicated without sorting; an empty names array is
invalid. `all` remains primary-workspace-only. A disabled-to-enabled change
returns `201`; an idempotent PUT or replacement returns `200`. The response is
`{ changed, replaced, partial, state }`. An equal selection keeps healthy
workers in place, but recovers an equal selection whose worker is stopped or
failed.

`DELETE /workspace/channel` is strict-gated and idempotent. It returns
`{ changed, state }`; a successful state is disabled. `POST
/workspace/channel/reload` is also strict-gated and re-reads settings,
re-resolves workspace groups, and force-reconciles the committed selection.
It returns `409 channel_worker_not_enabled` while disabled. The
`channel_reload` capability is advertised dynamically only while the manager
has a committed, reloadable selection.

Every enable, replace, reload, stop, and daemon shutdown enters one FIFO
lifecycle lane. GET does not wait for that lane. Workspace groups whose ordered
selection did not change remain online. Replacement failures attempt to stop
newly started workers and restore the previous committed selection. Clients
must inspect `rolledBack`, `rollbackError`, and `state` because cleanup or
restoration can also fail. The daemon keeps the channel-service PID lease
throughout a transaction and does not release it until every relevant child
exit is confirmed.

Stable control errors are:

- `400 invalid_channel_selection`, `channel_workspace_mismatch`, or `ambiguous_channel_workspace`
- `403 untrusted_workspace`
- `409 channel_service_conflict`, `channel_worker_not_enabled`, or `channel_control_workspace_limit_reached`
- `500 channel_worker_stop_failed`
- `502 channel_worker_start_failed`, with `rolledBack` and an optional credential-redacted `rollbackError`
- `503 daemon_draining`

Strict writes from a token-less primary request that reaches the gate without
trusted-loopback authority return `401 token_required` before control code
runs. Missing or invalid configured credentials and unpaired Local Control
credentials are rejected earlier with plain `401 Unauthorized`.
Trusted-loopback primary requests execute normally.
Once a request begins, disconnecting
the HTTP client does not cancel the lifecycle transaction; clients may retry
the same PUT safely.

For `502 channel_worker_start_failed`, the response may also include
`startupFailures[]` and `startupFailuresTruncated`. Each failure adds the
trusted `workspaceCwd` of the attempted worker. These fields describe the
failed transaction, while `state` describes the current state after rollback;
a later GET does not retain the failed attempt. A partially connected worker
instead returns success and exposes its failures in the worker snapshot. An
explicit `--channel` boot with no connected adapter fails startup. A settings-
derived startup failure is logged and allows the daemon to continue after
cleanup succeeds, subject to the global runtime startup timeout. Failure to
confirm cleanup retains the normal startup-failure behavior and service lease.

`qwen channel status` without `--daemon-url` continues to read pidfile metadata;
with `--daemon-url` it reads `GET /workspace/channel`. During a restart
window the serve-owned pidfile remains reserved, but `workerPid` is omitted so
clients do not display a stale worker process. On a multi-workspace daemon the
pidfile also carries an additive `workers[]` array (per-workspace
`workspaceId` / `workspaceCwd` / `channels` / live `workerPid`) while the
top-level `channels` (union) and `workerPid` (primary) stay populated for older
readers; single-workspace daemons keep the original single-worker shape. Worker
stdout/stderr are forwarded into the daemon log with bearer tokens, sensitive
worker environment values, and proxy URL credentials redacted.

### Workspace Channel management

The `channel_management` capability advertises workspace-scoped Channel
configuration and runtime management. The singular `/workspace` routes target
the primary runtime. `/workspaces/:workspace` resolves the exact registered,
trusted runtime and never falls back to the primary runtime.

Read-only discovery uses:

- `GET /workspace/channel-types`
- `GET /workspace/channels`
- `GET /workspaces/:workspace/channel-types`
- `GET /workspaces/:workspace/channels`

The catalog marks the types supported by this management API with
`manageable: true`. Instance snapshots include a revision, redacted secret
presence metadata, startup state, and runtime state; literal secrets are never
returned. Channel snapshots use `Cache-Control: no-store`.

Field descriptors can expose nested object metadata through `properties`.
Numeric descriptors can use `exclusiveMinimum` for open lower bounds. String
and secret descriptors can use `multiline` to ask clients for a multi-line text
area; the descriptor types allow it only on top-level fields. Clients that do
not render an advertised field kind must preserve its existing config value
instead of coercing or deleting it, and a client that renders a `multiline`
field in a single-line control must preserve the stored value verbatim instead
of writing back its newline-stripped input value. Object fields cannot be
required, and nested properties cannot be secrets or environment-resolvable
fields; those management protocols remain top-level only. A nested `required`
property is enforced only while its parent object is present in the write;
omitting the parent object leaves its nested requirements unchecked. Writes
replace each field's stored value wholesale, so preserving an object means
resending the stored object; the daemon does not merge partial objects.

Configuration writes use optimistic concurrency and the strict operator-authority
gate:

- `PUT /workspace/channels/:name`
- `DELETE /workspace/channels/:name`
- `PUT /workspace/channels/:name/startup`
- the equivalent `/workspaces/:workspace/...` routes

Each settings mutation includes `expectedRevision`. Upsert requests contain a
`config` object and may contain explicit secret operations: `preserve`,
`replace`, or `clear`. A Channel config cannot select a working directory
outside the resolved workspace.

Runtime actions are strict-gated `POST` requests to
`.../channels/:name/start`, `stop`, or `restart`. They operate only on the
worker owned by the resolved workspace.

Pairing management is available only for instances configured with the
`pairing` sender policy or group policy:

- `GET .../channels/:name/pairing-requests`
- `POST .../channels/:name/pairing-requests/approve` with `{ "code": "..." }`
- `GET .../channels/:name/pairing-approvals`
- `DELETE .../channels/:name/pairing-approvals` with
  either `{ "senderId": "..." }` or `{ "groupId": "..." }`

All pairing routes require strict operator authority and use `Cache-Control: no-store`.
Requests, approvals, and revocations are scoped to the selected Channel
instance and workspace. Pending requests include a typed user or group subject;
group requests also retain the sender who initiated the request. Approval
snapshots contain `senderIds` and `groupIds` because allowlists do not persist
display names. Revoking an unknown user or group returns
`404 channel_pairing_approval_not_found`.

### Channel delivery and Notify

`channel_delivery` advertises immediate, best-effort delivery support. It is a
protocol capability, not a worker health signal. Delivery never starts a
missing worker, falls back to another workspace, retries, persists an outbox,
or replays historical notifications.

Direct Notify bypasses Agent and Session and waits for one send attempt:

```http
POST /workspace/notify
POST /workspaces/:workspace/notify
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "service unavailable",
  "delivery": {
    "kind": "channel",
    "target": {
      "channelName": "dingtalk",
      "type": "user",
      "id": "platform-user-id"
    }
  }
}
```

Both routes use the strict mutation gate. The qualified route resolves only a
registered, trusted workspace. Success is `200 {delivered:true,deliveryId}`.
`delivered:true` means the Channel send Promise resolved; it does not prove
provider acceptance, user receipt, or a read receipt. Provider-specific
response validation and consistent error-reason semantics across IM adapters
are outside this V1 contract.
Errors are `400 channel_delivery_invalid`, `503 channel_worker_unavailable` or
`channel_delivery_queue_full`, `504 channel_delivery_timeout`, and `502
channel_delivery_rejected` or `channel_delivery_failed`. A timeout has an
unknown outcome and is not retried.
There is intentionally no separate connectivity-test endpoint: a normal
Notify call is the end-to-end test.

The replayable result event contains only correlation and sanitized status:

```json
{
  "type": "channel_delivery_result",
  "promptId": "prompt-1",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "session-1",
    "deliveryId": "prompt-1",
    "source": "prompt",
    "status": "failed",
    "promptId": "prompt-1",
    "code": "channel_worker_unavailable",
    "error": "Channel worker is not running."
  }
}
```

An empty successful Prompt final omits error fields:

```json
{
  "type": "channel_delivery_result",
  "promptId": "prompt-1",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "session-1",
    "deliveryId": "prompt-1",
    "source": "prompt",
    "status": "skipped",
    "promptId": "prompt-1"
  }
}
```

`source` is `prompt` or `scheduled`; `status` is `delivered`, `failed`, or
`skipped`. `skipped` means the eligible turn completed successfully but its
last tool-free assistant response block was empty or whitespace-only. The
daemon consumes the delivery authorization and publishes the event without
resolving a Channel Worker. Scheduled correlation uses `taskId` and `firedAt`.
The event never contains target IDs, message text, credentials, or webhook
secrets.

Security: the response never includes bearer tokens, client ids, full ACP
connection ids, device-flow user codes, or verification URLs. Both detail
levels may include additive `daemon.runId`, `daemon.logMode`, and
`daemon.logHealth`. `summary` omits the daemon log path and loss details;
`full` may include `logPath`, `logIssues`, `logDroppedRecords`, and
`logDroppedBytes` for authenticated operators. Degraded file logging adds the
path-free `daemon_log_degraded` warning to the normal status rollup.

### `GET /capabilities`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "protocolVersions": {
    "current": "v1",
    "supported": ["v1"]
  },
  "mode": "http-bridge",
  "features": [
    "health",
    "daemon_status",
    "capabilities",
    "multi_workspace_sessions",
    "..."
  ],
  "limits": {
    "maxRegisteredWorkspaces": 256,
    "maxChannelControlWorkspaces": 25,
    "maxPendingPromptsPerSession": 5,
    "maxSessionsPerWorkspace": 32,
    "maxTotalSessions": 800,
    "sessionRestoreTimeoutMs": 60000
  },
  "modelServices": [],
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path/to/primary-workspace",
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "id": "stable-workspace-id",
      "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/primary-workspace",
      "primary": true,
      "trusted": true
    },
    {
      "id": "stable-secondary-workspace-id",
      "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
      "displayName": "Payments Production",
      "primary": false,
      "trusted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Stable contract: when `v` increments the frame layout has changed in a backwards-incompatible way.

> **`protocolVersions`** describes the serve protocol versions the daemon can speak. `current` is the daemon's preferred protocol version and `supported` is the compatible set. Clients that require a specific protocol should check `supported`; feature-specific UI should still gate on `features`. Additive to v=1: older v=1 daemons omit this field, so SDK clients that target older builds should treat it as optional.

> **`modelServices` is always `[]` in Stage 1.** The agent uses its single default model service and doesn't enumerate it over the wire. Stage 2 will populate this from registered model adapters so SDK clients can build service-pickers; until then, do NOT rely on this field being non-empty.

> **`workspaceCwd`** is the canonical absolute path for the daemon's primary workspace. Use it to omit `cwd` on `POST /session` (the route falls back to this primary path) and to keep old single-workspace clients compatible. Additive to v=1: pre-§02 v=1 daemons omit the field — clients that target older builds should null-check before consuming it.

> **`workspaces[]`** lists every registered runtime. Newer single-workspace daemons include the primary runtime even when `multi_workspace_sessions` is absent so clients can discover the stable id required by workspace-qualified routes; older daemons may omit the array. Each entry is `{ id, cwd, displayName?, primary, trusted, removable? }`. `displayName` is presentation-only and omitted when unset. The first/primary workspace remains mirrored by `workspaceCwd`; new clients choose a non-primary runtime by passing that entry's `cwd` to `POST /session`. Untrusted workspaces are advertised for diagnostics but reject fresh session creation with `403 untrusted_workspace` until trust changes. `removable` is present on daemons that support runtime removal and is true only for process-dynamic or persistence-restored secondary runtimes.

> **`session_worktree_persistence_v1`** means the daemon can persist and verify Part 4A worktree ownership. Successful worktree creation responses, and restore responses whose child is either relocated while idle or already reports the verified worktree cwd, carry `worktree` metadata plus `worktreeState: "persisted-v1"`. A legacy best-effort restore, or a cold restore whose restore-prompt was fired rather than parked (`suppressWorktreeContextRestore` off, so the route asked the bridge for no deferral) and which therefore reports an active prompt with no current cwd, may still return `worktree` without that attestation. Clients requesting isolation must pre-flight this tag and verify each response; the `worktree` object alone is not durable-ownership proof.

> **`session_worktree_reset_v1`** means the daemon supports worktree ownership transfer: `POST /session/:id/worktree-reset` moves a persisted worktree session's checkout ownership to a fresh replacement session. Restore responses gain three typed 409 classifications alongside it: `worktree_session_superseded` (the session's sidecar carries a `supersededBy` link — the classification is decided from that link alone, before any marker read, and the link is written before the marker flips, so the body's `replacementSessionId` is a redirect to verify rather than proof of ownership: in a pre-commit interrupted state it names a session that is not the marker owner, cannot itself be restored, and is reaped by the retried reset), `worktree_marker_missing` (the checkout marker is absent; reset the task to recreate it — a restore retry cannot, because no restore path writes a marker), and `worktree_reset_interrupted` (a previous transfer crashed mid-flight with its sidecar links agreeing; retry the reset). The interrupted classification is checked first: a missing marker whose `supersedes`/`supersededBy` links agree surfaces as `worktree_reset_interrupted`, never as `worktree_marker_missing`. See the route section below for the transfer protocol and failure taxonomy.

The workspace feature tags and `workspaces[]` are dynamic. Clients that add a workspace must fetch `/capabilities` again after the mutation completes; the daemon does not broadcast capability changes to clients that cached an earlier response. Forgetting persistence does not unload an active runtime, so that runtime remains advertised until restart.

### `GET /brand`

The Web Shell's product branding, for hosts that want to white-label the shell. Resolved from `ui.brand` in the operator settings scopes. Gated by the `web_shell_brand` feature tag; a daemon without the route answers 404.

```json
{
  "name": "QiuQiu Code",
  "logoDataUri": "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%2F%3E"
}
```

> **Both fields are optional, and `{}` is a normal response.** An absent field means "use the client's built-in brand" — the Web Shell renders its own name and inline logo. Clients must not treat an empty body as an error.

> **The handler always answers 200, even when the configured logo was rejected.** A missing file, a symlink, a hard-linked file, a directory, a non-SVG document, or content over 32 KiB yields a body with no `logoDataUri`, and the reason is written to the daemon's stderr as `qwen serve: GET /brand: ui.brand.logoPath …`. A client therefore cannot distinguish "no brand configured" from "the operator's logo was refused"; the operator-facing channel is the daemon log. One advisory is softer than a rejection, and there are two: a root `<svg>` with no usable `viewBox` and no positive, non-percentage `width`/`height` (a malformed or zero-area viewBox counts as unusable), which the browser may render blank at the sidebar's fixed size; and a prefix-bound root whose unprefixed elements lack a default-namespace binding, which renders them invisible. Middleware in front of the handler answers before it ever runs — `401` when bearer auth is required and absent, `429` when the optional rate limiter is engaged. A draining daemon does not reject this route: the rate limiter is permissive while draining, so the handler keeps answering 200 until the listener closes and the client sees a connection failure instead. Startup is not a 503 on this route: on the default deferred-runtime path the request is _held_ until the runtime is ready and then answered 200, so a short client timeout is what can fire early. A 503 with `code: "daemon_runtime_starting"` reaches this route only on configurations that answer before the runtime is ready (e.g. `--open`) and is retryable; a 503 with `code: "daemon_runtime_failed"` is terminal until the daemon restarts and carries no `Retry-After` — do not retry it.

> **Workspace settings never contribute.** The route loads settings with `skipWorkspaceSettings`, so a repository's `.qwen/settings.json` cannot rename the product or name a file for the daemon to read and inline into every connected browser. Only System Defaults, User and System are read, in that precedence. For the same reason, a brand value is refused with a warning on the daemon's stderr whenever placeholder substitution would change it: substitution draws from the process-wide environment, which a workspace's `.qwen/.env` or `env` block populates first at boot. An unresolvable placeholder (the variable is unset) is kept verbatim, so a typo'd variable shows as literal text rather than silently falling back.

> **`logoDataUri` must be rendered as an image, never injected as markup.** The daemon does not sanitize the SVG it read. SVG loaded through an `img` src or a favicon href cannot execute script; SVG injected into the document can. The Web Shell only ever assigns it to an image context, and that invariant is what makes the absence of a sanitizer safe.

> **Process-global.** The route takes no workspace selector and no session id: the value derives from user-global configuration, so it is the same for every workspace the daemon serves. It is registered after `bearerAuth` and the rate limiter, and before the Web Shell SPA fallback, so it answers JSON for any `Accept` header.

### `POST /workspaces`

Register an additional workspace runtime. The path must be an existing, accessible, absolute directory that does not duplicate or nest with another registered workspace. Registration is process-local unless the client sends `persist: true`; clients must pre-flight `persistent_workspace_registration` before requesting persistence. When `workspace_display_name` is advertised, the request may also include an optional `displayName`.

```json
{
  "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
  "persist": true,
  "displayName": "Payments Production"
}
```

A newly created runtime returns `201`; promoting an already-active secondary workspace to persistent returns `200`. Persistent success includes `persisted: true`:

```json
{
  "id": "stable-workspace-id",
  "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
  "displayName": "Payments Production",
  "primary": false,
  "trusted": true,
  "persisted": true
}
```

`displayName` must be a string no longer than 256 characters after surrounding whitespace is trimmed. An empty result is treated as no name, and internal C0 (`U+0000`–`U+001F`) or DEL (`U+007F`) control characters are rejected. JSON `null` is not a creation value and returns `400 invalid_display_name`; omit the field to supply no initial name. Duplicate display names are allowed. A name supplied with a process-local registration lasts only for that daemon process; `persist: true` stores it with the persistent registration so it can be restored after restart. Repeating the request for an already-persistent workspace is idempotent and does not rename it.

Errors include `400 invalid_path` / `invalid_persist_flag` / `invalid_persist_target` / `invalid_display_name`, `409 workspace_exists` / `workspace_nested` / `workspace_limit_reached` / `workspace_registration_store_too_large`, `500 workspace_registration_store_error` / `runtime_creation_failed`, and `501 persistence_not_available` / `not_implemented`.

### `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace`

Update an active workspace resource selected by workspace ID or URL-encoded absolute cwd. The endpoint currently supports only display-name metadata:

```json
{ "displayName": "Payments Production" }
```

Send `{ "displayName": null }` to clear the name. Here `null` is an update-only deletion sentinel; non-null values follow the same string normalization rules as `POST /workspaces`. The response is the updated `{ id, cwd, displayName?, primary, trusted, removable? }` workspace projection. Runtime metadata is always updated. If the runtime has matching persistent registration identities, every alias is updated atomically through the existing schema-v1 registration store; the endpoint never creates or promotes a persistent registration.

Unsupported fields fail closed rather than being silently ignored. Errors include `400 empty_patch` / `invalid_display_name` / `unsupported_field` / `workspace_mismatch`, `409 workspace_registration_in_progress`, `500 workspace_registration_store_error`, and `503 daemon_shutting_down`.

### `DELETE /workspaces/:workspace`

Remove one removable secondary runtime. The selector follows the plural workspace routing rules and accepts either a workspace ID or a URL-encoded absolute cwd. The optional JSON body is `{ "force": boolean }`; omitting it requests non-force removal.

Non-force removal returns `409 workspace_busy` with an `activity` snapshot when the frozen runtime has sessions, prompts, pending starts, ACP connections, memory tasks, or workspace channel workers. Sending `{ "force": true }` requests termination of those resources. Persistence removal is the commit point: subsequent cleanup is bounded and best-effort, cleanup failures are logged, and logical removal still converges instead of restoring the runtime. A successful response is:

```json
{
  "removed": true,
  "workspaceId": "stable-workspace-id",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
  "forced": true,
  "persistedRegistrationRemoved": true,
  "activity": {
    "sessions": 2,
    "activePrompts": 1,
    "pendingSessionStarts": 0,
    "acpConnections": 1,
    "memoryTasks": 0,
    "channelWorkers": 0,
    "voiceSessions": 0
  }
}
```

An immediately busy non-force request returns a fast pre-drain activity snapshot. Once drain starts, the busy or success response contains the final snapshot taken after admission and ACP drain gates close and before cleanup begins. Errors include `400 invalid_force_flag` / `workspace_mismatch`, `409 workspace_busy` / `primary_workspace_removal_forbidden` / `static_workspace_removal_forbidden` / `workspace_removal_in_progress` / `workspace_registration_in_progress`, `500 workspace_persist_failed` / `workspace_runtime_removal_failed`, `501 workspace_runtime_removal_unsupported`, and `503 daemon_shutting_down`.

### `GET /workspace-registrations`

List the persisted desired workspace set for this primary workspace. Entries remain visible with `active: false` when a stored directory could not be restored during the current start.
An entry remains `active: true` while its runtime is draining because the runtime still owns live resources until removal completes.
Entries include optional `displayName` when the persistent registration has one.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "primaryWorkspace": "/canonical/path/to/primary-workspace",
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "stable-registration-id",
      "cwd": "/canonical/path/to/secondary-workspace",
      "displayName": "Payments Production",
      "active": true,
      "persisted": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Returns `501 persistence_not_available` when no registration store is configured and `500 workspace_registration_store_error` when the store cannot be read.

### `DELETE /workspace-registrations/:id`

Forget one persisted registration. This does not unload an active runtime or terminate its sessions; `restartRequired: true` means the active runtime disappears on the next daemon restart.

```json
{ "removed": true, "active": true, "restartRequired": true }
```

Returns `404 workspace_registration_not_found`, `500 workspace_registration_store_error`, or `501 persistence_not_available`. Like other mutation routes, this endpoint requires mutation authentication when daemon authentication is enabled.

### Read-only runtime status routes

These routes report daemon-side runtime snapshots. They are additive v1 routes,
do not mutate state, and do not change the serve protocol version. Workspace
status routes intentionally do **not** start the ACP child process just because
a client polls a GET route: if the daemon is idle, they return
`initialized: false` with an empty snapshot. Session status routes require a
live session and return `404 { code: "session_not_found", ... }` for unknown
ids.

create a channel, but reaching a runtime route can first start a deferred daemon
runtime, whose configured startup policy may independently preheat ACP. The
snapshot is not a lease: clients must let Session creation revalidate or start
the channel.

### ACP preheat

Capability tag: `workspace_acp_preheat`.

`POST /workspace/acp/preheat?timeoutMs=N` best-effort initializes the primary
workspace ACP channel. `timeoutMs` defaults to 5000 and must be a positive
integer no greater than 60000. Concurrent callers and Session creation share
the same bridge initialization. A request timeout ends only that HTTP wait; it
does not cancel the shared initialization.

```ts
interface WorkspaceAcpPreheatResult {
  ready: boolean;
  channelLive: boolean;
  durationMs: number;
  reason?: 'timeout' | 'error';
  error?: string;
}
```

`ready` always equals `channelLive`. A live response omits `reason` and
`error`; otherwise `reason` is `timeout` or `error`. `durationMs` measures the
current HTTP call, not the full lifetime of an initialization the call joined.
Operational timeout or failure returns HTTP 200. Invalid `timeoutMs` returns
400, while authentication, rate limiting, and deferred-runtime failures retain
their normal responses.

Both ACP workspace routes are singular and primary-workspace-only. Clients
must not use them for a secondary workspace or interpret either response as a
durable readiness guarantee.

Common status cell:

```ts
type DaemonStatus =
  | 'ok'
  | 'warning'
  | 'error'
  | 'disabled'
  | 'not_started'
  | 'unknown';

type DaemonErrorKind =
  | 'missing_binary'
  | 'blocked_egress'
  | 'auth_env_error'
  | 'init_timeout'
  | 'restore_timeout'
  | 'protocol_error'
  | 'missing_file'
  | 'parse_error';

interface DaemonStatusCell {
  kind: string;
  status: DaemonStatus;
  error?: string;
  errorKind?: DaemonErrorKind;
  hint?: string;
}
```

`errorKind` is a closed enum shared by `/workspace/preflight`,
`/workspace/env`, and (eventually) MCP guardrails so SDK clients can render
remediation per category instead of parsing free-form messages. The original
seven status literals came from #4175; `restore_timeout` was added separately
for session restore requests. `blocked_egress` remains reserved until the
egress probe lands.

Status payloads never expose MCP env values, headers, OAuth/service-account
details, provider API keys, provider `baseUrl` / `envKey`, skill body, skill
filesystem paths, hook definitions, or values of secret environment
variables. `/workspace/env` reports the **presence** of whitelisted env
vars only; proxy URLs are stripped of credentials and reduced to
`host:port` before they hit the wire.

### `GET /workspace/mcp`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "discoveryState": "completed",
  "servers": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "docs",
      "mcpStatus": "connected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
      "description": "Documentation server",
      "extensionName": "docs-ext"
    }
  ]
}
```

`discoveryState` is one of `not_started`, `in_progress`, or `completed`.
`transport` is one of `stdio`, `sse`, `http`, `websocket`, `sdk`, or
`unknown`. `errors` is omitted when discovery succeeds.

**MCP client guardrails (issue [#4175](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/4175)).** Current daemons extend the payload with four additive fields and a capability-scoped budget cell:

```jsonc
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "discoveryState": "completed",
  "clientCount": 3,
  "clientBudget": 2,
  "budgetMode": "enforce",
  "budgets": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_budget",
      "scope": "workspace",
      "status": "error",
      "errorKind": "budget_exhausted",
      "hint": "Raise --mcp-client-budget or remove servers from mcpServers config.",
      "liveCount": 2,
      "budget": 2,
      "mode": "enforce",
      "refusedCount": 1,
    },
  ],
  "servers": [
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "a",
      "mcpStatus": "connected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
    },
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "b",
      "mcpStatus": "connected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
    },
    {
      "kind": "mcp_server",
      "status": "error",
      "name": "c",
      "mcpStatus": "disconnected",
      "transport": "stdio",
      "disabled": false,
      "disabledReason": "budget",
      "errorKind": "budget_exhausted",
      "hint": "...",
    },
  ],
}
```

`budgetMode` is one of `enforce`, `warn`, or `off`. `clientBudget` is absent when no budget was set. `budgets[]` is **always an array** on daemons advertising `mcp_guardrails` (possibly empty when `budgetMode === 'off'`); older daemons omit the field entirely. When `mcp_workspace_pool` is advertised, the cell has `scope: 'workspace'` and covers the selected workspace runtime's shared pool. When that tag is absent, including under `QWEN_SERVE_NO_MCP_POOL=1`, the legacy manager emits `scope: 'session'`. Consumers MUST tolerate additional unrecognized scope values.

`disabledReason` on per-server cells distinguishes operator-disabled (`'config'` — `disabledMcpServers` config list) from budget-refused (`'budget'` — discovered but never connected due to `enforce` mode). Refusals are deterministic by `Object.entries(mcpServers)` declaration order. The per-server `status: 'error', errorKind: 'budget_exhausted'` shadows the raw `mcpStatus: 'disconnected'` (which is true but not the operator-facing severity).

Budget enforcement is capability-driven. With `mcp_workspace_pool`, sessions inside one workspace runtime share transports and one `WorkspaceMcpBudget`; different workspace runtimes never share a pool or budget. Without the tag, each ACP session's `McpClientManager` enforces its own copy of the cap and the snapshot represents that legacy session view.

**Detecting budget pressure.** Two surfaces, both populated post-PR-14b:

- **Push events** (advertised via `mcp_guardrail_events`): subscribe to `GET /session/:id/events` and narrow `mcp_budget_warning` / `mcp_child_refused_batch` frames through `KnownDaemonEvent`. The state machine fires once per upward 75% crossing (re-armed below 37.5%); refusals are coalesced once per discovery pass under `enforce` mode.
- **Snapshot poll** (advertised via `mcp_guardrails`): `GET /workspace/mcp` and inspect the budget cell (`budgets[0]`) together with `mcp_workspace_pool` to determine its scope:

- `budgets[0].status === 'warning'` ⇔ `liveCount >= 0.75 * clientBudget` (matches the hysteresis threshold PR 14b's push event will use).
- `budgets[0].status === 'error'` ⇔ `refusedCount > 0` (one or more servers refused this discovery pass).
- `budgets[0].status === 'ok'` ⇔ below the 75% threshold AND no refusals.

Recommended poll cadence: aligned with whatever already polls `/workspace/mcp`; the snapshot is cheap and the budget cell carries no extra discovery cost. SDK clients that subscribe to push events still benefit from the snapshot for state-after-extended-disconnect (the SSE replay ring depth is finite — `--event-ring-size`, default 8000 — so a client offline longer than the ring's coverage falls back to snapshot resync).

### `GET /workspace/skills`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "skills": [
    {
      "kind": "skill",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "review",
      "description": "Review code",
      "level": "project",
      "modelInvocable": true,
      "userInvocable": false,
      "installedPath": "/home/alice/project/.qwen/skills/review/SKILL.md",
      "argumentHint": "[path]"
    },
    {
      "kind": "skill",
      "status": "ok",
      "name": "database-review",
      "description": "Review database changes",
      "level": "extension",
      "modelInvocable": true,
      "installedPath": "/home/alice/.qwen/extensions/alibabacloud-database-suite/skills/database-review/SKILL.md",
      "extensionName": "alibabacloud-database-suite",
      "extensionDisplayName": "Alibaba Cloud Database Suite"
    }
  ]
}
```

`level` is one of `project`, `user`, `extension`, or `bundled`.
`userInvocable` (boolean, optional) is omitted for normal skills (meaning
`true`) and is present only as `false` when the skill cannot be invoked
manually. It does not gate the settings-only Skill toggle routes described
below. `modelInvocable` is independent: `false`
means the skill remains manually available but is hidden from model invocation.
`installedPath` is the existing absolute path to the skill's `SKILL.md`; the
daemon returns it as stored without separately resolving symlinks or
canonicalizing it. Current daemons emit it for every skill, while clients must
tolerate its absence from older v1 daemons. Skill bodies, hooks, `skillRoot`,
and other skill configuration remain excluded. `errors` is omitted when
discovery succeeds.

For extension-owned skills, `extensionName` is the canonical manifest name and
is safe to use as the owner identity. `extensionDisplayName` is an optional,
localized presentation value and may be non-unique. New clients should display
`extensionDisplayName ?? extensionName`; older daemons omit the display field.

Repeated reads are served from the last committed workspace snapshot,
periodically revalidated against the child's in-memory cache. A read never
scans skill directories or reparses `SKILL.md` files. The child does verify
that its extension sources are unchanged — one `readdir` of the extensions
directory plus a `stat` per entry, the enablement file, and the store's
activation state — and refreshes only when they moved, so an extension
installed or toggled outside the daemon is still picked up on the next read.
Safe and bare mode skip the check, matching their exclusion of extensions.

### `GET /workspace/providers`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "current": { "authType": "qwen", "modelId": "qwen3(qwen)" },
  "providers": [
    {
      "kind": "model_provider",
      "status": "ok",
      "authType": "qwen",
      "current": true,
      "models": [
        {
          "modelId": "qwen3(qwen)",
          "baseModelId": "qwen3",
          "name": "Qwen 3",
          "description": null,
          "contextLimit": 4096,
          "isCurrent": true,
          "isRuntime": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Models are grouped by auth type. Provider connection diagnostics live on
`/workspace/preflight`'s `providers` cell; environment preflight lives on
`/workspace/preflight` and `/workspace/env` (below). `errors` is omitted
when snapshot construction succeeds.

### `GET /workspace/env`

Reports the daemon process's runtime, platform, sandbox, proxy, and the
**presence** of whitelisted secret environment variables. Always answers
from `process.*` state — the daemon never spawns an ACP child to serve
this route, and the response is identical whether ACP is up or idle. The
`acpChannelLive` field is informational only.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "acpChannelLive": false,
  "cells": [
    { "kind": "runtime", "name": "node", "status": "ok", "value": "22.4.0" },
    { "kind": "platform", "name": "darwin", "status": "ok", "value": "arm64" },
    {
      "kind": "sandbox",
      "name": "SANDBOX",
      "status": "disabled",
      "present": false
    },
    {
      "kind": "proxy",
      "name": "HTTPS_PROXY",
      "status": "ok",
      "present": true,
      "value": "proxy.internal:1080"
    },
    {
      "kind": "proxy",
      "name": "NO_PROXY",
      "status": "disabled",
      "present": false
    },
    {
      "kind": "env_var",
      "name": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
      "status": "ok",
      "present": true
    },
    {
      "kind": "env_var",
      "name": "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL",
      "status": "disabled",
      "present": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Cell shape:

```ts
type DaemonEnvKind =
  | 'runtime' // name: 'node' | 'bun' | 'unknown'; value: process.versions.node
  | 'platform' // name: process.platform; value: process.arch
  | 'sandbox' // name: 'SANDBOX' | 'SEATBELT_PROFILE'; value optional
  | 'proxy' // name: HTTP_PROXY | HTTPS_PROXY | NO_PROXY | ALL_PROXY; value: redacted host
  | 'env_var'; // presence-only; value field is ALWAYS omitted

interface DaemonEnvCell extends DaemonStatusCell {
  kind: DaemonEnvKind;
  name: string;
  present?: boolean;
  value?: string;
}
```

**Redaction policy.** `kind: 'env_var'` cells never include a `value`
field; clients see `present: boolean` only. `kind: 'proxy'` cells run the
raw env value through credential redaction (`redactProxyCredentials`) and
then through `URL` parsing so the wire only carries `host:port`. `NO_PROXY`
is passed through redaction verbatim because it is a host list rather than
a URL. The whitelist of enumerated secret env vars currently includes
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`,
`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN`. Other
env vars are not enumerated, so accidentally-set secrets stay invisible.

### `GET /workspace/preflight`

Reports daemon readiness checks. **Daemon-level cells** (`node_version`,
`cli_entry`, `workspace_dir`, `ripgrep`, `git`, `npm`) are always
populated from `process.*` and `node:fs`. **ACP-level cells** (`auth`,
`mcp_discovery`, `skills`, `providers`, `tool_registry`, `egress`)
require a live ACP child — when the daemon is idle they emit
`status: 'not_started'` placeholders. The route never spawns ACP solely
to populate cells; the corresponding cells fall back to `not_started`.

Idle response (no ACP child):

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "acpChannelLive": false,
  "cells": [
    {
      "kind": "node_version",

      "status": "not_started",
      "locality": "acp",
      "hint": "spawn a session to populate"
    },
    {
      "kind": "skills",
      "status": "not_started",
      "locality": "acp",
      "hint": "spawn a session to populate"

      "locality": "acp",
      "hint": "spawn a session to populate"
    },
    {
      "kind": "egress",
      "status": "not_started",
      "locality": "acp",
      "hint": "egress probing lands in PR 14 (#4175)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Cell shape:

```ts
type DaemonPreflightKind =
  | 'node_version'
  | 'cli_entry'
  | 'workspace_dir'
  | 'ripgrep'
  | 'git'
  | 'npm'
  | 'auth'
  | 'mcp_discovery'
  | 'skills'
  | 'providers'
  | 'tool_registry'
  | 'egress';

interface DaemonPreflightCell extends DaemonStatusCell {
  kind: DaemonPreflightKind;
  locality: 'daemon' | 'acp';
  detail?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

`errorKind` semantics:

- `missing_binary` — Node version below required, missing `QWEN_CLI_ENTRY`,
  ripgrep / git / npm not on PATH (warnings rather than errors for the
  optional binaries).
- `missing_file` — `boundWorkspace` does not exist or is not a directory;
  skill parse error pointing at a missing or unreadable file.
- `parse_error` — `SKILL.md` parse failure, malformed config JSON.
- `auth_env_error` — `validateAuthMethod` returned a non-null failure
  string, or a `ModelConfigError` subclass propagated from provider
  resolution.
- `init_timeout` — `withTimeout` reject in the bridge (an actual timeout
  while waiting on an ACP roundtrip). Recognized via the
  `BridgeTimeoutError` typed class. Note: a transient `mcp_discovery`
  `warning` cell with `connecting > 0` does NOT carry this kind — that's
  a normal handshake-in-progress state, distinct from a real timeout.
- `restore_timeout` — a session load or resume exceeded the dedicated restore
  budget. The REST response is `504` and is retryable; it is distinct from
  child initialization and from the bounded replay-window limits.
- `protocol_error` — ACP `extMethod` rejected because the channel closed
  mid-request, or because tool registry was unexpectedly absent.
- `blocked_egress` — reserved for PR 14 (#4175). PR 13 leaves the
  `egress` cell as `status: 'not_started'`.

If the bridge fails to reach the ACP child while serving a preflight
request (e.g. a mid-request channel close), the envelope's `errors` array
carries a single `ServeStatusCell` describing the failure and the cells
fall back to `not_started` ACP placeholders. Daemon-level cells are still
returned.

### `GET /workspace/tools`

Return the tool catalog reported by the primary workspace's ACP child. This is
a legacy primary-workspace route: it has no workspace selector and must not be
used to infer the tools of a non-primary runtime.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "initialized": true,
  "acpChannelLive": true,
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "ReadFile",
      "displayName": "Read",
      "description": "Read a file",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

When no ACP child is live, the route still returns `200` with
`acpChannelLive: false`, an empty `tools` array, and a `not_started` entry in
the optional `errors` array. Unexpected bridge failures use the standard `500`
bridge error response. The TypeScript SDK method is `workspaceTools()`; there
is no dedicated capability tag, so clients that support older daemons should
treat `404` as unsupported.

### Workspace file routes

All file paths are resolved through the daemon's primary workspace. Responses use
workspace-relative paths and never return absolute filesystem paths for normal
success cases. Successful file responses include:

```http
Cache-Control: no-store
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

Filesystem errors use this JSON shape:

```json
{
  "errorKind": "hash_mismatch",
  "error": "expected sha256:..., found sha256:...",
  "hint": "re-read the file and retry with the latest hash",
  "status": 409
}
```

`errorKind` values include `path_outside_workspace`, `symlink_escape`,
`path_not_found`, `binary_file`, `file_too_large`, `untrusted_workspace`,
`permission_denied`, `parse_error`, `hash_mismatch`,
`file_already_exists`, `text_not_found`, and `ambiguous_text_match`.

#### `GET /file`

Reads a text file. Query params: `path` (required), `maxBytes`, `line`, `limit`,
and `cursor`. The daemon rejects binary files. Files above the 256 KiB
full-snapshot
cap require at least one explicit window argument (`line`, `limit`, or
`maxBytes`); a request with none of them remains `file_too_large`. Such a
window is streamed, and its returned UTF-8 content stays capped at 256 KiB.
`maxBytes` always applies to the UTF-8 response bytes after decoding, including
when the source uses another supported encoding within the full-snapshot cap.

Line offsets are resolved by scanning from the start of the file, so a window
is also refused with `file_too_large` when reaching it would read more than
8 MiB (`MAX_TEXT_SCAN_BYTES`). Use `GET /file/bytes` to reach a deeper offset
directly. Large text in an encoding the route cannot decode returns
`binary_file`, not `file_too_large` — retrying with a smaller window cannot
help, and `readBytes` is the same remedy that already applies to binary.

For files within the full-snapshot cap, the response includes `hash`, a SHA-256
digest over the raw on-disk bytes for the whole file, even when `line`, `limit`,
or `maxBytes` returned a slice. Large partial windows omit `hash`, retain the
complete `sizeBytes`, set `truncated: true`, and return
`originalLineCount: null` when the stream stops before EOF.

##### Paging with `cursor`

Requires the `workspace_file_read_cursor` capability. A response that has more
to give returns `hasMore: true` and, when a file byte offset is derivable, a
`nextCursor` token. Passing it back as `cursor` resumes in O(1), where a deep
`line` offset costs a scan from byte 0 and is refused past 8 MiB.

```
GET /file?path=big.log&limit=500          → { content, nextCursor, hasMore: true }
GET /file?path=big.log&limit=500&cursor=… → next page
```

`cursor` and `line` are mutually exclusive (`parse_error`) — both name a
starting point. A malformed or over-long cursor is `parse_error`; a cursor
whose file has been replaced or truncated is `hash_mismatch` (409). Appending
does **not** invalidate an outstanding cursor, which is the case the feature
exists for.

`content` omits the terminating newline of its last line, as every other read
does, so a client reassembling pages joins them with `\n`. `hasMore` is not a
restatement of `nextCursor`: a small non-UTF-8 file read with a `limit` has
more content but no derivable byte offset, so it reports `hasMore: true` with
`nextCursor: null`. The cursor is also null when the byte cap cuts the current
line, because resuming from that offset would return a partial line. For many
short lines, lower `limit` until the page ends before the byte cap and returns
a cursor. For a single oversized line, request the following line explicitly
(for example, `line=2` when starting at line 1), then continue with cursors;
use `GET /file/bytes` when the complete oversized line is required.

```json
{
  "kind": "file",
  "path": "src/index.ts",
  "content": "export {};\n",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bom": false,
  "lineEnding": "lf",
  "sizeBytes": 11,
  "returnedBytes": 11,
  "truncated": false,
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "matchedIgnore": null,
  "originalLineCount": null
}
```

#### `GET /file/bytes`

Reads raw bytes from a file without decoding. Query params: `path` (required),
`offset` (default `0`), and `maxBytes` (default `65536`, max `262144`). This
route supports bounded windows on large binary files without slurping the whole
file. The response includes `hash` only when the returned window covers the
entire file.

```json
{
  "kind": "file_bytes",
  "path": "assets/logo.png",
  "offset": 0,
  "sizeBytes": 3912,
  "returnedBytes": 3912,
  "truncated": false,
  "contentBase64": "...",
  "hash": "sha256:..."
}
```

#### `GET /stat`

Return metadata for one primary-workspace path. Query parameter `path` is
required.

```json
{
  "kind": "stat",
  "path": "src/index.ts",
  "type": "file",
  "sizeBytes": 128,
  "modifiedMs": 1700000000123
}
```

`type` is `file`, `directory`, `symlink`, or `other`. The route uses the
workspace file boundary and the common filesystem error envelope described
above. The TypeScript SDK method is `fileStat()`.

#### `GET /list`

List one primary-workspace directory. Query parameter `path` is required;
`includeIgnored=1` (or `true`) includes entries matched by ignore rules. The
response is capped at 2,000 entries and sets `truncated: true` when more exist.

```json
{
  "kind": "list",
  "path": ".",
  "entries": [{ "name": "src", "kind": "directory", "ignored": false }],
  "truncated": false,
  "matchedIgnore": null
}
```

Each entry's `kind` is `file`, `directory`, `symlink`, or `other`. The
TypeScript SDK method is `dirList()`.

#### `GET /glob`

Match paths inside the primary workspace. Query parameter `pattern` is
required. Optional `cwd` narrows the search, `includeIgnored=1` (or `true`)
includes ignored paths, and `maxResults` is an integer from 1 to 50,000
(default 5,000).

```json
{
  "kind": "glob",
  "pattern": "**/*.ts",
  "cwd": "",
  "matches": ["src/index.ts"],
  "count": 1,
  "truncated": false,
  "durationMs": 4
}
```

Matches are workspace-relative. Invalid query values return `400`; workspace
trust, containment, missing-path, and unexpected failures use the common
filesystem error envelope. The TypeScript SDK method is `glob()`.

#### `POST /file/write`

Creates or replaces a text file. This is a strict mutation route: a token-less
trusted-loopback primary request is authorized. A token-less primary request
that reaches the gate without trusted-loopback authority returns
`401 { "code": "token_required" }`. Configured-token and Local Control
credential failures are rejected earlier with plain `401 Unauthorized`; with
`--require-auth`, the global bearer middleware rejects unauthenticated requests
before the route runs.

Body:

```json
{
  "path": "src/new.ts",
  "content": "export const value = 1;\n",
  "mode": "create"
}
```

```json
{
  "path": "src/existing.ts",
  "content": "export const value = 2;\n",
  "mode": "replace",
  "expectedHash": "sha256:..."
}
```

`mode` must be `create` or `replace`. `create` never overwrites an existing
file (`409 file_already_exists`). `replace` requires `expectedHash`; missing or
malformed hashes are `400 parse_error`, and stale hashes are
`409 hash_mismatch`. `expectedHash` is `sha256:` plus 64 lowercase hex
characters, computed over raw on-disk bytes.

`bom`, `encoding`, and `lineEnding` may be supplied. Replacement preserves the
existing file's encoding profile by default; explicit fields override it.
Binary writes are out of scope.

The daemon writes to a random temp file in the target directory, fsyncs where
supported, re-checks the current hash immediately before `rename()`, then
renames into place. This prevents partial-file observation and serializes
daemon-originated writes to the same file, but it is not a cross-process
kernel compare-and-swap: an external editor can still race in the tiny window
between final hash check and rename.

```json
{
  "kind": "file_write",
  "path": "src/existing.ts",
  "mode": "replace",
  "created": false,
  "sizeBytes": 24,
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bom": false,
  "lineEnding": "lf",
  "matchedIgnore": null
}
```

#### `POST /file/edit`

Applies one exact text replacement to an existing text file. This is also a
strict mutation route and requires `expectedHash`.

```json
{
  "path": "src/config.ts",
  "oldText": "timeout: 30000",
  "newText": "timeout: 60000",
  "expectedHash": "sha256:..."
}
```

`oldText` must be non-empty and occur exactly once. No match returns
`422 text_not_found`; multiple matches return `422 ambiguous_text_match`.
The route preserves encoding, BOM, and line endings, and re-checks
`expectedHash` immediately before the atomic rename.

Explicit writes/edits to ignored paths are allowed because the authenticated
caller named the path. Success responses and audit events include
`matchedIgnore: "file" | "directory" | null`.

```json
{
  "kind": "file_edit",
  "path": "src/config.ts",
  "replacements": 1,
  "sizeBytes": 128,
  "hash": "sha256:...",
  "encoding": "utf-8",
  "bom": false,
  "lineEnding": "lf",
  "matchedIgnore": null
}
```

### `GET /session/:id/context`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "state": {
    "models": {},
    "modes": {},
    "configOptions": []
  }
}
```

For a top-level session, `state` mirrors the same ACP
model/mode/config-option shapes used by `POST /session`,
`POST /session/:id/load`, and `POST /session/:id/resume`. A
`subagent.`-prefixed virtual session id resolves against its parent runtime
and returns an empty `state` object.

### `GET /session/:id/supported-commands`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "availableCommands": [
    {
      "name": "init",
      "description": "Initialize the project",
      "input": null,
      "_meta": { "source": "builtin" }
    }
  ],
  "availableSkills": ["review"]
}
```

`availableCommands` is the same command snapshot used by the
`available_commands_update` SSE notification. `availableSkills` lists skill
names only; clients must not expect skill bodies or paths over this route.

### `GET /session/:id/tasks`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "now": 1700000000000,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "kind": "agent",
      "id": "agent-1",
      "label": "reviewer: check failure",
      "description": "check failure",
      "status": "running",
      "startTime": 1699999999000,
      "runtimeMs": 1000,
      "outputFile": "/tmp/agent-1.jsonl",
      "isBackgrounded": true,
      "subagentType": "reviewer"
    },
    {
      "kind": "agent",
      "id": "agent-2",
      "label": "general-purpose: run the failing test",
      "description": "run the failing test",
      "status": "running",
      "startTime": 1699999999500,
      "runtimeMs": 500,
      "outputFile": "/tmp/agent-2.jsonl",
      "isBackgrounded": false,
      "subagentType": "general-purpose",
      "parentAgentId": "agent-1",
      "parentName": "reviewer",
      "depth": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This route is a read-only out-of-band snapshot. It is intentionally not a
prompt and can be queried while the session is streaming. The response only
contains whitelisted metadata from the agent, shell, and monitor task
registries; controllers, timers, offsets, pending messages, and raw registry
objects are never exposed.

Agent tasks spawned by another sub-agent (nested sub-agents, bounded by
`maxSubagentDepth`) carry three optional lineage fields: `parentAgentId` (the
spawning agent task's `id`), `parentName` (the spawning agent's
`subagentType`, captured at registration so it survives the parent's eviction
from the registry), and `depth` (0-based launch depth; 0 = spawned by the
top-level session). Agents launched by the top-level session omit
`parentAgentId` and `parentName`; clients should treat all three fields as
optional and fall back to a flat list when they are absent.

### `POST /session/:id/tasks/:taskId/workflow-action`

Controls a workflow run, or starts a new one. The ACP method is
`_qwen/session/tasks/workflow_action`.

```json
{
  "action": "run-script",
  "script": "export const meta = { name: 'daily-audit', description: 'Audits yesterday' }\nreturn await agent(args.question)",
  "args": { "question": "which tables grew?" },
  "sourceRef": { "id": "definition-7", "revision": "rev-3" }
}
```

What `taskId` names depends on the action:

| `action`                            | `taskId`                                                           | Starts a run           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `pause`, `resume`, `retry`, `rerun` | the run id                                                         | `retry` and `rerun` do |
| `delete-history`                    | the run id                                                         | no                     |
| `run-saved`                         | the saved workflow's name, `<extension>:<name>` for an extension's | yes                    |
| `run-script`                        | a start key the caller chooses                                     | yes                    |

`args`, `sourceRef` and `script` are read by `run-saved` and `run-script`
only. `args` is bound to the script's `args` global and may be any JSON value;
`sourceRef` is the caller's own `{id, revision}`, recorded on the run, its
journal and its snapshot; `script` is the source `run-script` runs and is
required by it. A retry or rerun replays the original run's own `args` and
`sourceRef` — that is what makes it the same run — so those fields are ignored
alongside the control actions.

A started run is session-owned: it runs in the background without an approval
prompt, and its completion reaches the session's completion channel. It is a
`retry`/`rerun` target afterwards like any other run.

`retry` and `rerun` also accept a run restored from history (`isHistorical` in
`GET /session/:id/tasks`), such as one a daemon restart interrupted: the run is
started again from its snapshot's script, `args` and `sourceRef`, and it
registers in, and reports its completion to, the session that sent the
action. A `retry` resumes the run's journal under the same run id and applies
to a `failed` run that no process is still running; a `rerun` starts a new run
id from any finished run. A history entry carrying `argsOmitted` was launched
with `args` too large to keep, so neither action applies to it. Neither does a
snapshot written before `args` were kept, which carries neither `argsOmitted`
nor `argsRecorded`: a run's journal is keyed from a hash of its `args`, so
restarting one whose `args` its history cannot name would replay nothing and
re-dispatch every agent. Both refusals are `workflow_args_unavailable`, and
`GET /session/:id/tasks` reports both as `argsUnavailable` on the entry, so a
client can withhold the two actions instead of discovering the refusal by
making the call. `argsOmitted` stays beside it as the reason, for a client
that wants to say which. The `args` themselves are never put on the wire.

`run-script` passes no definition name, so the run is labelled by the script's own
`export const meta` — a compiled script should declare one, or the run shows
only its id.

The response is `{"changed": true, "status": "running", "taskId": "<runId>"}`
for a started run, `{"changed": true, "status": "<status>"}` for a control
action that took effect, and `{"changed": false}` when nothing happened:
Workflow is unavailable for the session (disabled, bare mode, untrusted
folder), the workspace is untrusted, the saved workflow name is unknown, the
run id is unknown, or another start is already in flight under the same
`taskId`. Only overlapping starts are deduplicated: two concurrent
`run-script` calls under one `taskId` start one run. Once that start returns,
the key is released; submitting it again can start another run, even if the
first run is still active. The key does not provide retry idempotency after
a lost response.

A rejected parameter is a `400` (`-32602` over ACP), not a started run: an
unknown `action`, a `run-script` with no `script`, a `sourceRef` that is not
`{id, revision}` of non-empty strings, or a script rejected before launch
because of invalid syntax or a determinism violation. Workflow start input
errors carry `workflow_invalid_params` and retain the rejection message.

Four refusals come from the run's stored state rather than the request. Each
is `-32602` over ACP, carrying its `errorKind` and its `data.httpStatus`.
Three are a `409`; the fourth, `workflow_not_recorded`, is a `503`, because
nothing was started and the same call may simply be made again: a `retry`
records that the run is running again before it starts — that record is what
keeps another process from starting it a second time — and the record could
not be written.

| `code` / `errorKind`           | HTTP  | When                                                                                                                                                          | What to do                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workflow_journal_unavailable` | `409` | a `retry` whose run has no journal on disk, or one that cannot be read                                                                                        | `rerun` it, which starts it from the beginning                 |
| `workflow_args_unavailable`    | `409` | a `retry` or `rerun` of a history entry marked `argsUnavailable`: its `args` were too large to keep, or its snapshot predates keeping them                    | start it again with `run-saved` or `run-script` and its `args` |
| `workflow_run_live_elsewhere`  | `409` | a `retry` of a run whose checkpoint records a process that has not been seen to exit — one still running, one on another machine, or one whose pid was reused | `rerun` it, which takes a new run id                           |
| `workflow_not_recorded`        | `503` | a `retry` whose record that the run is running again could not be written, so it did not start                                                                | make the same call again; the run is untouched                 |

`workflowToolFeatures` in `GET /session/:id/supported-commands` advertises
`runSavedArgs` and `runScript`; a daemon without them accepts neither the start
input nor the `run-script` action. It also carries `nameOnly`, true when the
session's model may run named workflows only (`tools.workflowNameOnly`): the
model's own `script` and `scriptPath` calls are refused, while every action
above, `run-script` included, still starts runs. `retryHistorical` is true when
`retry` and `rerun` accept a run restored from history; an older daemon answers
them with `{"changed": false}`, so a client should offer those controls for a
history entry only when it is reported.

### `GET /session/:id/lsp`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "enabled": true,
  "configuredServers": 1,
  "readyServers": 1,
  "failedServers": 0,
  "inProgressServers": 0,
  "notStartedServers": 0,
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "typescript",
      "status": "READY",
      "languages": ["typescript", "javascript"],
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "typescript-language-server"
    }
  ]
}
```

`status` is one of `NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `READY`, or `FAILED`.
Optional `error` is present on failed servers when available. Disabled LSP
(including bare mode) returns HTTP 200 with `enabled: false`, zero counts, and
`servers: []`. LSP enabled with no configured servers returns `enabled: true`,
`configuredServers: 0`, and `servers: []`. If initialization fails before the
client exists, the response may include `initializationError`; if a live client
cannot provide a snapshot, the response includes `statusUnavailable: true`.

This route exposes only stable client-facing fields. It intentionally omits
debug internals such as process IDs, spawn args, stderr tails, root URIs, and
workspace-folder paths.

### `GET /session/:id/resources`

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/session/path",
  "skills": {
    "v": 1,
    "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/session/path",
    "initialized": true,
    "skills": []
  },
  "mcp": {
    "v": 1,
    "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/session/path",
    "initialized": true,
    "discoveryState": "completed",
    "servers": []
  }
}
```

This live-session-owner route reads the selected session's Config through its
own ACP connection. It does not combine the process-global or workspace-level
status routes, initialize a cold runtime, attach a client, or fall back to the
primary workspace. Unknown and persisted-only sessions return the existing
`session_not_found` response.

The nested objects use the exact `GET /workspace/skills` and
`GET /workspace/mcp` status contracts. Their `workspaceCwd` fields identify
the Config that produced the snapshot and match the top-level value. Existing
redaction rules still apply: MCP credentials and headers, environment values,
Skill bodies, and raw settings never appear in the response. MCP
authentication, pool, workspace-budget, and workspace discovery-error
enrichments are absent because their backing state is workspace-owned or keyed
only by server name rather than by session. Status, discovery, and accounting
from the selected session's own MCP manager remain available.

### Standalone session lifecycle (`standalone_sessions_v1`)

When `/capabilities.features` contains `standalone_sessions_v1`, the daemon exposes a process-global route family for top-level standalone sessions owned by its dedicated Conversations runtime. These routes never accept a workspace selector and never fall back to the primary workspace. Direct embeds that cannot construct the complete Conversations ownership, runtime, directory, lifecycle, and deletion-journal dependency graph omit both the feature and all routes below.

When `POST /standalone/sessions` carries the legacy `modelServiceId`, the response includes `modelApplied`: `false` means the spawn-time model switch failed (also surfaced via the `model_switch_failed` session event) and the session is running on the agent default model — the create itself still succeeds so the caller can warn, release, or retry explicitly.

Bodies must be JSON objects with no unknown fields. IDs are RFC UUID v1-v5 values; the daemon canonicalizes them to lowercase. Batch requests contain 1-100 strings and are validated and de-duplicated before mutation. A batch failure is reported as `{ sessionId, code, message }` and does not roll back successful operations on other IDs. `fileCleanupPending` means transcript deletion committed but journal-authorized sidecar or managed-directory cleanup must be retried by reconciliation; the session is already logically removed.

Only explicit standalone transcripts and the documented top-level legacy compatibility shape are visible. Child, Live, project, worktree, ambiguous, unreadable, or deletion-journaled records fail closed. Creation continues if its HTTP response disconnects; a committed session is not deleted, and the response client is detached. Recover by exact GET followed by load/resume instead of retrying create as an attach.

Archive, unarchive, repair, rename, and delete share the same per-session lifecycle admission as load/resume and prompts. Delete uses transcript unlink as its durable commit point and a private journal plus atomic managed-directory staging for crash recovery. Recovery restores the directory when the transcript remains intact and completes cleanup when the transcript is gone; any mismatched identity, conflicting path, foreign owner, or ambiguous transcript returns a structured fail-closed error.

### `POST /session`

The optional `startupConfig` contract is described under [Capabilities](#capabilities). Unlike legacy best-effort model selection, a rejected startup selection fails creation.

Spawn a new agent or attach to an existing one (under `sessionScope: 'single'`, the default).

Distinct from `modelId` on `POST /session/:id/model`, which selects the model **within** an already-bound service.

Old daemons (pre-#4175 PR 5) silently ignore the field — pre-flight `caps.features.session_scope_override` before sending.

The route returns success only after relocation, exclusive ownership-marker creation, sidecar persistence, and a final runtime-generation check.                                                                                                                      |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "attached": false,
  "worktree": {
    "slug": "feature-a",
    "path": "/canonical/path/.qwen/worktrees/feature-a",
    "branch": "worktree-feature-a"
  },
  "worktreeState": "persisted-v1"
}
```

`attached: true` means a session for that workspace already existed and you're now sharing it.

`worktreeState` is present only for an attested worktree session. Legacy best-effort restore may return `worktree` without `worktreeState`. A cold Part 4A restore whose restore-prompt was fired rather than parked (`suppressWorktreeContextRestore` off, so the route asked the bridge for no deferral) also returns unverified `worktree` metadata until the prompt settles: the child reads active with no reported cwd, relocation is impossible under a live prompt, and the route keeps the session rather than killing the one the caller just recovered. Neither response is durable execution-root proof. A client that requested worktree isolation must require `worktreeState: "persisted-v1"` and the expected canonical path before routing a prompt; an initial load may be retried after the active prompt settles. On SDK reattach the outcome splits on whether the response still carries `worktree` metadata: a response that carries it with a missing attestation or a changed path is terminal for that client — the new attachment is detached and the prompt is not retried — while a response with no `worktree` object at all heals: the client drops its cached worktree claim, keeps the new attachment, and retries the prompt in the same call. The heal does not gate that retry, so one turn can still execute in a directory the client can no longer attest (an `exit_worktree` the client never saw is the ordinary cause, and the client cannot distinguish it from a cleared in-memory association). An isolation-aware caller must therefore re-verify the worktree attestation itself before dispatching a prompt; the dropped claim only makes that caller fail closed at its own identity gate on its next load or selection.

Caller-supplied IDs are unique across all currently registered workspace runtimes and every still-live bridge generation, including draining replacements. A live, pending, active, archived, or worktree-backed duplicate returns `409 session_id_conflict`. Invalid values return `400 invalid_session_id`; an unavailable live-owner or persisted-state check returns retryable `503 session_id_admission_unavailable`. Retry with bounded backoff after bridge or storage health changes; `retryable` means another attempt is safe, not that an immediate retry will succeed. If the downstream agent returns a different ID, the daemon removes that orphan and returns `500 session_id_not_honored`. After an ambiguous response, load or resume the known ID instead of retrying create as an attach.

Multi-client integrations that want independent conversations should send
`sessionScope: "thread"` on each `POST /session`. Use the default `single`
scope only when clients intentionally share one collaborative session; shared
sessions serialize prompts through one FIFO, visible through
`/daemon/status` as `runtime.activity.pendingPrompts` and
`runtime.activity.queuedPrompts`.

Concurrent `POST /session` calls for the same workspace are **coalesced** to one spawn — both callers get the same `sessionId`, exactly one reports `attached: false`. If the underlying spawn fails (init timeout, malformed agent output, OOM), **all coalesced callers receive the same error** — the in-flight slot is cleared so a follow-up call can retry from scratch.

### `GET /session/:id/status`

Return the live summary from the runtime that owns the session. This route does
not load a persisted-only session and never falls back to the primary runtime.
Pre-flight `caps.features.session_status`.

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-10T08:00:00.000Z",
  "clientCount": 1,
  "hasActivePrompt": true,
  "isWaitingForPermission": false,
  "isWaitingForUserQuestion": false,
  "pendingInteractionCount": 0,
  "pendingInteractions": []
}
```

The response is the `DaemonSessionSummary` wire shape. Optional fields include
display and source metadata, `activeWorkState`, `updatedAt`, `turnError`,
worktree or branch metadata, and PR bindings. `404` means
no live owner exists; a bootstrapping, draining, or unavailable owner returns
`503` instead of falling back. An untrusted non-primary owner returns
`403 untrusted_workspace`, and an id live in more than one workspace returns
`500 ambiguous_session_owner`. The TypeScript SDK method is `sessionStatus()`.

### ACP `session/new` caller-supplied ID

ACP clients request the same behavior through the extension metadata field:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "session/new",
  "params": {
    "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/workspace",
    "_meta": {
      "qwen-code/sessionId": "550E8400-E29B-41D4-A716-446655440000"
    }
  }
}
```

The response contains the normalized lowercase ID. Primary and workspace-qualified ACP mounts share admission with REST, including `session/load` and `session/resume`. Invalid IDs use ACP `INVALID_PARAMS` with `data.httpStatus=400` and `data.errorKind="invalid_session_id"`; conflicts use `data.httpStatus=409`; unavailable live-owner or persisted-state checks use `data.httpStatus=503` and `data.retryable=true`.

An ACP-created session that never receives a prompt leaves no persisted trace, and the daemon reaps it when its owning connection closes with zero attached sessions. After that reap the same ID can be created again — that is connection lifecycle, not ID reuse: while the connection (or any attachment) is live, admission rejects the duplicate.

### `POST /session/:id/load`

`liveReplayMode` and `compactedReplayMode` accept `full` (default) or `summary`.
They project `liveJournal` and `compactedReplay` respectively without changing
stored history. Page selection precedes filtering, so visible items may be fewer
than `historyPageSize`. Invalid values return `400 invalid_live_replay_mode` or
`400 invalid_compacted_replay_mode`. Standalone load accepts both options but
reports invalid values as `400 invalid_request`.

Restore a persisted ACP session by id and replay its history through SSE. The path id is authoritative; any `sessionId` field in the body is ignored. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_load` — older daemons return `404` for this route.

Request:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/workspace"
}
```

| `cwd` | no       | Same canonicalization + `workspace_mismatch` rules as `POST /session`. Omit to inherit `/capabilities.workspaceCwd`. When `features` contains `multi_workspace_sessions`, callers may pass any trusted registered `workspaces[].cwd`; untrusted non-primary workspaces return `403 untrusted_workspace`. `mcpServers` is intentionally NOT accepted here — daemon-wide MCP is settings-driven (matches `POST /session`). |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "persisted-1",
  "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
  "attached": false,
  "state": {
    "models": { ... },
    "modes": { ... },
    "configOptions": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

`state` mirrors ACP's `LoadSessionResponse` — `models` is a `SessionModelState`, `modes` a `SessionModeState`, `configOptions` an array of `SessionConfigOption`. Missing fields are agent-decided. Late attachers (the `attached: true` paths below) get the SAME `state` snapshot the original load caller saw — the daemon caches it on the entry; runtime mutations (e.g. `model_switched`) are delivered on the SSE stream, not on subsequent attach responses.

`attached: true` means the session was already live (either from a prior `session/load`/`session/resume`, or because a coalesced concurrent caller raced just ahead).

When the persisted session owns a Part 4A worktree, load/resume validates its sidecar, canonical containment, and exact checkout marker. An idle child is relocated before the response; an active child is attested only when its reported cwd already equals the worktree, and an active child whose reported cwd is absent or elsewhere fails closed instead of being moved under its prompt — except for a cold restore that could not defer its restore-prompt (`suppressWorktreeContextRestore` off — any restore whose effective source is not Channel-owned — or a bridge without the deferral API): that shape still returns `worktree` without `worktreeState`, unrelocated, and the session survives. The relocated and attested responses return `worktree` plus `worktreeState: "persisted-v1"`. Restore-side typed 409 classifications (advertised by `session_worktree_reset_v1`): `worktree_session_superseded` when the session's sidecar carries a `supersededBy` link — the classification reads that link alone, under the per-checkout ownership lock and before any marker read, so a transfer that rolls back while the load waits cannot redirect the caller to a session the same daemon is deleting; the link is written before the marker flips, though, so the body's `replacementSessionId` is a redirect to verify rather than proof that ownership moved: after a committed transfer callers should load that id instead and update their bookkeeping, but in a pre-commit interrupted state it names a replacement that is not the marker owner, whose own restore returns `worktree_reset_interrupted`, and that the retried reset then reaps — so `replacementSessionId` must not be persisted as the task's session id until a load of it succeeds; `worktree_reset_interrupted` when the restored session's `supersedes` link and the named session's `supersededBy` link agree but the marker never moved or is absent — a previous reset crashed mid-transfer and a retried reset is the repair; and `worktree_marker_missing` when the checkout marker is absent without that agreeing link pair — resetting the task is the repair, because no restore path recreates a marker and a restore retry returns the same 409. The interrupted classification is checked first, so an agreeing link pair never surfaces as `worktree_marker_missing`. Whenever the effective restore source is Channel-owned, the route suppresses the agent's best-effort cleanup for Part 4A or unclassifiable sidecar state, so stale, foreign, ambiguous, or ownership-mismatched persisted state is preserved and fails the request. Persisted source metadata takes precedence; when it is absent, the load/resume request supplies the effective source. A structurally valid legacy sidecar without the Part 4A `workspaceCwd` field retains the existing best-effort agent restore, may be cleaned up by that path, and may return `worktree` without `worktreeState`; clients must not infer isolation from that compatibility metadata. Apart from that explicit legacy compatibility case, only sessions whose effective restore source is not Channel-owned retain the existing best-effort cleanup before route validation. A missing sidecar returns no worktree attestation; isolation-aware clients must reject that response rather than rebinding the session to the shared workspace.

**History replay over SSE.** While `loadSession` is in flight on the agent side, the agent may emit `session_update` notifications for persisted turns, or return bulk replay updates in the response metadata. The daemon seeds those events into the session's bounded replay snapshot window before the route response returns. For live sessions, `POST /session/:id/load` only promises that bounded window (`compactedReplay`, `liveJournal`, `lastEventId`), not the full transcript. The window is byte-capped by `--compacted-replay-max-bytes` (default 4 MiB, maximum 256 MiB); if older replay entries were dropped, `compactedReplay[0]` is an id-less `history_truncated` marker. The in-flight `liveJournal` is separately capped by `--max-journal-events` (default 10 000 replay entries) and `--max-journal-bytes` (default 8 MiB of serialized source events). These are per-session **baseline** caps. When an in-flight turn outgrows them, the daemon first tries adaptive growth: it raises that session's caps toward double (up to a per-session hard cap of 256 MiB, entries scaled proportionally, limited by the remaining pool headroom) while the growth granted across every live session fits in one daemon-wide growth pool sized at 5% of the daemon's effective memory budget — the `--memory-budget-mb` value when passed, capped at resolved available memory, otherwise 50% of auto-detected memory — capped at `1024` MB. Accounting is daemon-wide — a multi-workspace daemon runs one bridge per workspace and all of them share the single pool. Growth is on demand and only as far as the pool allows; an operator-pinned `--max-journal-events` or `--max-journal-bytes` disables it, as does a host whose effective budget falls below the 1024 MB minimum (`insufficientMemory`): the pool is 0 and adaptive growth is disabled outright. Consecutive compatible `agent_message_chunk` or `agent_thought_chunk` source events share a replay entry, up to 256 source events per entry, while tool, attribution, provenance, and discrete-message boundaries remain intact. When the journal still exceeds its (possibly grown) caps after the growth the pool allows — including when no headroom is granted or a grant covers only part of the overshoot — the oldest entries are dropped whole (so the retained tail can be much smaller than the byte cap) and a `history_truncated` marker with `scope: 'live_journal'` is prepended; its `truncatedEvents` and `retainedEvents` fields count source events, not replay entries, and its `maxBytes` / `maxEvents` reflect the caps in force (which may already have grown). Clients should render that marker as status and continue applying retained events. Full persisted transcript access is exposed separately through `GET /session/:id/transcript`.

The replay-window byte caps apply after the child has reconstructed the persisted transcript; they do not cap the on-disk JSONL read. A restore that exceeds the daemon budget returns `504` with a `Retry-After` derived from the restore budget (clamped to 5-120s) and `{code: "session_restore_timeout", errorKind: "restore_timeout", retryable: true, sessionId, action, timeoutMs}`. The daemon fences the still-running ACP request and cleans up any late session instead of registering it. A retry for the same id returns `409 restore_in_progress` with `reason: "awaiting_abandoned_cleanup"` and a `Retry-After` of the restore budget (clamped to 5-120s) until that cleanup settles. If late restore cleanup is uncertain, or the abandoned restore has still not settled a full restore budget after its deadline, new sessions on that workspace return `503 acp_channel_unavailable` with `reason: "restore_cleanup_failed"` or `"restore_settlement_overdue"`. A timed-out session initialization follows the same fail-closed admission policy for an older ACP child that settles late: inconclusive cleanup returns `reason: "new_session_cleanup_failed"`, while a request that remains unsettled for one further initialization budget returns `reason: "new_session_settlement_overdue"`. A settlement-overdue state clears immediately after a late failure settles, or after a late success completes its exact-ID cleanup; inconclusive cleanup transitions to the corresponding cleanup-failed state instead. Cleanup-failed states last until the workspace channel drains and is recycled. Already-live sessions remain usable in either case.

**Errors:**

- `404` — persisted session id doesn't exist (`SessionNotFoundError`).
- `400` — `workspace_mismatch` (same shape as `POST /session`).
- `403` — `untrusted_workspace` when `cwd` targets an untrusted non-primary workspace.
- `503` — `session_limit_exceeded` (counts against `--max-sessions`; in-flight restores are accounted for too).
- `504` — `session_restore_timeout`; retryable, with a `Retry-After` derived from the restore budget (clamped to 5-120s) because the same session id stays fenced until late cleanup settles.
- `504` — `init_timeout`; NOT retryable, no `Retry-After`, no `sideEffectPossible`, no fence installed. Emitted when channel initialization times out before the restore request is dispatched (the `ensureChannel` stage); the restore was never attempted, so no session id is fenced and no cleanup is pending.
- `503` — `acp_channel_unavailable` when the workspace channel is closed to new session work. `reason` says why: `restore_cleanup_failed` when an abandoned restore could not be cleaned up conclusively; `restore_settlement_overdue` when an abandoned restore has still not settled one full restore budget after its deadline; `new_session_cleanup_failed` when a session created after the public initialization timeout could not be closed conclusively; or `new_session_settlement_overdue` when the timed-out initialization has still not settled one further initialization budget after its deadline. Existing sessions remain available. A settlement-overdue state clears after a late failure settles or a late success completes its exact-ID cleanup; inconclusive cleanup transitions to the matching cleanup-failed state, which requires the workspace channel to drain and recycle. The body carries `retryAfterSeconds` and the header a matching budget-derived `Retry-After` so clients use an operation-budget-scale backoff instead of polling at the ordinary 5-second cadence.
- `409` — `restore_in_progress` (a `session/resume` for the same id is already in flight, or a fresh spawn supplied an id a restore owns). `Retry-After: 5` while the restore is active; a budget-derived hint once it is fenced as `awaiting_abandoned_cleanup`. Same-action races (two concurrent `session/load` for the same id) coalesce — exactly one returns `attached: false`, the rest return `attached: true` with the same `state`.
- `409` — `session_workspace_conflict` when the same session id is already live or being restored by another workspace runtime.
- `409` — `session_archived` when the id exists only under `chats/archive/`; call `POST /sessions/unarchive` before `load` or `resume`.
- `409` — `session_archiving` when archive or unarchive is in flight for the same id. `Retry-After: 5`.
- `409` — `session_conflict` when the id exists in both `chats/` and `chats/archive/`; delete the session with `POST /sessions/delete` before loading.

### `GET /session/:id/transcript`

Return one page of id-less `session_update` replay frames reconstructed from the active persisted JSONL transcript. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_transcript` — older daemons return `404` for this route.

Query parameters:

| Field                 | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cursor`              | no       | Opaque base64url cursor returned by the previous page. Omit for the first page. The cursor is daemon-issued and tamper-checked; modifying it returns `400 invalid_transcript_cursor`. It binds to the transcript file identity and frozen first-page byte size; deleting, truncating, replacing, or archiving the file invalidates it and returns `409`. |
| `limit`               | no       | Target number of active `ChatRecord`s in a page. Defaults to `100`, maximum `500`. A backward page may expand to at most `3 * limit` records to preserve turn and tool-call/result boundaries. One record can produce multiple replay frames, so `events.length` may be larger still. Invalid values return `400 invalid_transcript_limit`.              |
| `direction`           | no       | The only accepted value is `backward`, which starts a page at the newest records. Omit the parameter to page forward on a first page, or to continue the direction frozen in `cursor`. Cannot be combined with `cursor`, `beforeRecordId`, `atRecordId`, or `snapshot`.                                                                                  |
| `beforeRecordId`      | no       | Start a backward page before this record id. Implies backward, so do not also send `direction`. Cannot be combined with `cursor` or `atRecordId`; may be paired with `snapshot`.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `compactedReplayMode` | no       | `full` (default) or `summary`. Projects `events` after page selection, so visible count may be smaller than `limit`. Does not change stored history or cursor selection. Also accepted by the workspace-qualified transcript route. Invalid values return `400 invalid_compacted_replay_mode`.                                                           |

Response:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "sessionId": "persisted-1",
  "events": [
    {
      "v": 1,
      "type": "session_update",
      "data": {
        "sessionUpdate": "user_message_chunk",
        "content": { "type": "text", "text": "..." }
      }
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "opaque",
  "hasMore": true,
  "startTime": "2026-07-08T00:00:00.000Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-07-08T00:01:00.000Z"
}
```

`events` are replay frames only: `{ v: 1, type: "session_update", data: SessionUpdate }`. They do not carry EventBus ids, and the response never includes `lastEventId`. Calling this route does not call `/load`, attach a client, seed the live EventBus, create a live session, or change the current live replay window. Live and inactive active sessions are both reconstructed by the child-side read-only status method so replay uses the same workspace settings, runtime output directory, emitters, and `/load` history semantics without mutating daemon session state.

The first page freezes the current JSONL snapshot size. Later pages read only that byte prefix, so appends after page 1 do not change the result set. If the file disappears, is truncated below the frozen size, is replaced with a different inode, or is moved to archive, the next page returns `409` and the client should restart from page 1 or ask the user to reopen the transcript.

To protect daemon memory and latency, snapshots above the transcript indexing cap fail before the daemon scans the JSONL. Clients receive `413 transcript_too_large` and should fall back to export/offline processing or ask the user to shorten/archive older history.

`partial: true` and `replayError` may appear if replay conversion fails after producing some frames. Partial responses never include `nextCursor`, so clients cannot silently paginate past records that were not converted.

**Errors:**

- `400` — invalid `limit`, `cursor`, `direction`, `beforeRecordId`, or session id shape. The paging parameters are mutually exclusive: `cursor` cannot be combined with `beforeRecordId`, `atRecordId`, or `snapshot`; `snapshot` requires `atRecordId` or `beforeRecordId`; `atRecordId` requires `snapshot`; and `backward` cannot be combined with a cursor or any record anchor.
- `404` — active persisted session id does not exist on the first page request.
- `409` — `session_archived`, `session_archiving`, or `session_conflict` from the same loadability checks as `/load`.
- `409` — transcript snapshot is unavailable because the file was deleted, truncated, replaced, or archived after the cursor was issued; this also applies when preflight can no longer find the active file for a cursor request.
- `413` — `transcript_too_large` when the frozen transcript snapshot exceeds the daemon indexing cap.
- `413` — `transcript_page_too_large` when one aggregate record exceeds the workspace-qualified page budget or the serialized page exceeds its response budget.

### `GET /session/:id/export`

Download the primary workspace's active persisted session transcript. The
optional `format` query is `html` (default), `md`, `json`, or `jsonl`.
Pre-flight `caps.features.session_export`.

Successful responses are attachments with a sanitized filename,
`Cache-Control: no-store`, and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. The content
type is `text/html`, `text/markdown`, `application/json`, or
`application/jsonl` according to the selected format. The route reads
persisted storage only: it does not resolve a live owner, start ACP, or attach
a client. Use the workspace-qualified route below when the target may be in a
non-primary workspace. Invalid formats return `400 invalid_export_format`;
missing active sessions return `404`; archived, transitioning, or conflicting
storage returns `409`. The TypeScript SDK method is `exportSession()`.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/transcript`

Return the same `DaemonSessionTranscriptPage` projection as the singular route from the selected registered workspace's active persisted JSONL. Pre-flight `workspace_persisted_transcript`; this capability is independent of `multi_workspace_sessions` and works for a trusted single-workspace primary selected by id or cwd.

The selector and query parameters follow the existing plural workspace and transcript rules. Trusted primary and secondary runtimes and untrusted secondary runtimes may read. An untrusted primary returns `403 untrusted_workspace`. Archived content is not returned.

For this workspace-qualified route, `limit` is the maximum record count for forward pages. A backward page may expand to at most `3 * limit` records so turns and tool-call/result pairs stay intact. A page may stop earlier at the 4 MiB persisted-source budget and return a continuation cursor. Serialized responses are capped at 32 MiB and cursors at 64 KiB. If replay state would exceed the cursor cap, the page returns its successfully converted events with `partial: true`, `hasMore: false`, and no `nextCursor`.

Forward pages and cursor pages are implemented entirely inside the daemon process. A backward first page for a live session first crosses a one-record workspace-bridge flush barrier so the persisted tail is current; that barrier may start ACP and load workspace settings. The persisted page read itself does not parse project-defined agents or skills or create/repair `session-transcript-cursor-key`. Tool frames use persisted tool names and descriptions without consulting the runtime tool registry. Its HMAC cursor key exists only in daemon memory, is isolated per workspace, and rotates on restart; a cursor from a previous daemon process returns `400 invalid_transcript_cursor`.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/export`

Export the selected registered workspace's active persisted session as an attachment. Pre-flight `workspace_session_export`; do not infer support from `session_export` or `workspace_qualified_rest_core`. The selector resolves as exact workspace id first, then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization. Both primary and secondary runtimes must be trusted. An untrusted runtime returns `403 untrusted_workspace` before session or format validation.

The optional `format` query is `html` (default), `md`, `json`, or `jsonl`. The body, MIME type, filename sanitization, `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and attachment disposition match `GET /session/:id/export`. The legacy route remains bound to primary storage.

The plural route reads only the selected workspace's active persisted JSONL under the existing shared archive coordinator. It does not scan other workspace stores, fall back to primary, resolve a live owner, call the workspace bridge, start ACP, attach a client, or load settings. A session id that exists only in another workspace returns `404 { code: "session_not_found" }`; archived sessions return `409 session_archived`. Invalid formats return `400 invalid_export_format`, and storage races retain the existing `session_archiving` and `session_conflict` errors.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/archive/export`

Export the selected registered workspace's archived persisted session as an attachment. Pre-flight `workspace_archived_session_export`; support cannot be inferred from active export or plural core capabilities. Workspace selector resolution and trust checks run before session-id and format validation.

TypeScript SDK callers use `WorkspaceDaemonClient.exportArchivedSession(sessionId, options)`. The method always uses native REST and returns the existing `DaemonSessionExportResult` attachment projection.

The optional `format` query, response body, MIME type, sanitized filename, cache policy, security header, and attachment disposition are identical to the active workspace export. Archived source JSONL is capped at 256 MiB before reconstruction; a larger file returns `413 transcript_too_large` with `sessionId`, `snapshotSize`, and `maxBytes`. The active export keeps its existing size behavior.

The route reads only `chats/archive/<id>.jsonl` in the selected trusted workspace under a shared archive-coordinator lease. It does not inspect active content for fallback, scan another workspace, resolve a live owner, call a bridge, start ACP, attach a client, or load settings. An active-only id returns `409 { code: "session_not_archived" }`; a missing id returns `404 { code: "session_not_found" }`; simultaneous active and archived files return `409 session_conflict`; and an archive transition returns `409 session_archiving` with `Retry-After: 5`.

### `POST /session/:id/resume`

Restore a persisted ACP session by id WITHOUT replaying history through SSE. The model context is restored internally on the agent side (via `geminiClient.initialize` reading `config.getResumedSessionData`); the SSE stream stays clean for clients that already have history rendered. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_resume`; `unstable_session_resume` remains a deprecated compatibility alias for older clients.

Accepts the same `cwd`, `approvalMode`, `sourceType`, and `sourceId` fields
as `/load`. `historyPageSize` is not parsed here and is silently ignored.
`liveReplayMode` and `compactedReplayMode` are parsed and validated — invalid
values return `400 invalid_live_replay_mode` or `400 invalid_compacted_replay_mode`
— but only the legacy-standalone compatibility restore forwards them; ordinary
resume drops them. None of these load-only fields is part
of the published resume request. Same response shape — `state` mirrors ACP's
`ResumeSessionResponse`. Same error envelope, including
`409 restore_in_progress` (which fires when a `session/load` is in flight;
`session/resume` racing behind another `session/resume` coalesces).

Use `/load` when the client has no history rendered (cold reconnect, picker → open). Use `/resume` when the client already has the turns on screen and only needs the daemon-side handle back.

> ⚠️ **Why is `unstable_session_resume` still advertised?** The daemon's HTTP route and `session_resume` capability are stable for v1, but the bridge still calls ACP's `connection.unstable_resumeSession`. The old tag remains only so SDKs that shipped before `session_resume` can keep working.

### `POST /session/:id/worktree-reset`

Transfer a persisted Part 4A worktree session's checkout ownership to a fresh replacement session. Pre-flight `session_worktree_reset_v1` — older daemons return `404` for this route. The route is how Channel named-task `/clear` resets a worktree task without discarding its files: the replacement gets a brand-new conversation, and the superseded session keeps its transcript in the catalog but can never be restored again.

Request body (all fields optional):

```json
{
  "cwd": "/canonical/path",
  "modelServiceId": "service-id",
  "approvalMode": "plan",
  "sourceType": "channel",
  "sourceId": "dingtalk-main"
}
```

`cwd` follows the same resolution as `POST /session/:id/load` and may be omitted for the daemon's primary workspace. The metadata fields stamp the replacement session with the same thread-scope and source conventions as a worktree creation.

On success the route returns `200` with the replacement session's create-shape response — the new `sessionId`, `workspaceCwd`, `currentCwd` equal to the verified canonical worktree path, `worktree` metadata, and `worktreeState: "persisted-v1"`. Callers discard their handle on the old id and use the replacement id from then on; the old id's later restore returns `worktree_session_superseded` with `replacementSessionId`, which clients may also use to self-heal stale bookkeeping — but only once a load of that id has succeeded. The classification is decided from the sidecar link alone, and that link is written before the marker flips, so an interrupted pre-commit transfer hands back a replacement that is not the marker owner, whose own restore returns `worktree_reset_interrupted`, and that the retried reset then reaps.

This route never reads `X-Qwen-Client-Id`, so the replacement spawns unattached — but the success response is not registration-free. A fresh transfer mints an owner-style `clientId` for that spawn, registers it on the replacement, and reports it in the body; an idempotent resume of a committed transfer reports none. The minted id is not an attachment (the replacement's attach count is unchanged, so `killSession` with `requireZeroAttaches` still sees it as unattached), but a live client registration is exactly what holds the daemon's idle cleanup off: detach an id you do not keep using, or the replacement stays live indefinitely — and a replacement that is still live with no marker is the shape a later reset refuses to dismantle. Treat the response as the replacement's identity, and attach it through the normal `POST /session/:id/load` or `/resume` surface when a registered client is required.

The transfer is serialized per checkout against worktree restores and other resets, refuses to run while either session is busy (prompt in flight or a pending interaction), and arms an admission barrier on the superseded session: while it is armed, exactly eight writers are refused with `worktree_reset_active` at admission — `POST /session/:id/prompt`, `/rewind`, `/cd`, `/branch`, `/fork`, `/shell`, `/goal`, and `/tasks/:taskId/workflow-action`. The other seven are fenced because each moves the session cwd or starts work in it without passing prompt admission: a shell command runs in the session's effective cwd, which for a relocated worktree session is the checkout itself; a fork agent runs its tools in that cwd; a rewind restores files relative to it; a cd moves it, including into a subdir of the checkout; a branch mutates the superseded session's persisted history and spawns a derivative session while ownership is in flux; a goal `resume` promotes a queued turn and queues a continuation; and a workflow action runs a saved workflow or a caller-supplied script, or restarts a live run, through the session's own tool registry. `POST /session/:id/continue` is not a ninth gate: it drives an accepted continuation through the fenced prompt admission and is refused there. That list is the whole fence, and the fence is not everything that reaches the child — the release and stop paths stay usable mid-transfer by design (cancelling a task, clearing a goal, detaching a client, killing the session), and the daemon-internal background-notification enqueue — a sub-session's completion acknowledgement to its parent, which no HTTP route calls — is unfenced as well, because it enqueues a notification rather than starting a turn. The transfer's last step severs the superseded session's client registrations, clears its in-memory worktree association, and reports whether the superseded session is actually gone. A survivor — a child that still holds background work, so the idle close the last detach triggers is refused and deferred — is surfaced rather than papered over: the daemon logs it, the barrier stays armed on that entry as the only fence left, and the `200` body carries `supersededSessionLive: true` so the caller knows the superseded id is still live and re-attachable inside the checkout whose ownership just moved. Crash safety is per window, and the write order defines the windows: the old sidecar's `supersededBy` link is written first, then the replacement's sidecar carrying `supersedes`, and the marker flips last. A crash before the flip therefore leaves the old session authoritative in one of three shapes a retry tells apart — no links at all (the replacement is an ordinary orphan and a retry simply starts a fresh transfer), the backward link alone with the replacement's sidecar missing (a retry fails closed with `worktree_reset_invalid_state` and leaves the interrupted state untouched for operator repair), or both links present (a retry rolls the partial transfer back and completes a fresh one — unless the interrupted replacement cannot be removed because a client is still attached to it, in which case the rollback fails closed with `worktree_reset_invalid_state` and keeps both links, so a later retry converges once that client is gone). A crash after the flip leaves the replacement authoritative and a retry resumes as a no-op. The old session is never deleted and the worktree checkout is never removed by reset.

**Errors:**

- `404` — `session_not_found` when the session record does not exist.
- `409` — `worktree_reset_unsupported` when the session has no valid Part 4A sidecar (not a worktree session).
- `409` — `worktree_reset_active` when a session involved in the transfer is busy; retry once it settles. Admission of any writer the barrier covers — a prompt, rewind, cwd change, branch, fork, shell command, goal control, or workflow-task action — on a session mid-transfer fails with the same code.
- `409` — `worktree_reset_invalid_state` for corrupt sidecar, invalid marker, containment failure, or an inconsistent supersede link pair. Non-destructive for what this request started: any partial transfer this request began is rolled back before the caller sees it, while the fail-closed resume branches — an invalid marker, a supersede link pair that does not agree (including a backward link whose replacement sidecar is missing), an ambiguous marker owner, and a replacement that is still live on this daemon while the marker is absent — leave the pre-existing interrupted state untouched for operator repair, so that shape stays visible to a later reset or restore. A retry against one of those states re-reads it and returns the same 409: it does not converge, so the state needs operator repair rather than a retry loop. The specific reason is written to the daemon log rather than the wire.
- `500` — fail-closed internal errors (for example a bridge without reset support, or a relocation rejection after rollback); not retryable as-is. One `500` differs in kind: a marker transfer whose own post-commit tail failed _after_ the flip durably committed reports that ownership moved, never runs the destructive rollback, and is repaired by retrying the reset, which resumes the committed transfer idempotently.

### `GET /workspace/:id/session-info` and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session-info`

Return aggregate persisted session counts for the selected workspace without changing the paginated session-list path:

```json
{
  "active": 450,
  "archived": 30,
  "total": 480,
  "live": 2,
  "expensive": true,
  "cost": "disk_scan"
}
```

`active`, `archived`, and `total` count local JSONL sessions. `live` is the matching in-memory bridge count and is omitted for a registered untrusted secondary workspace because that persisted-only read must not query live state. `expensive` is always `true` and `cost` is always `"disk_scan"`; clients must call this endpoint infrequently rather than poll it. If the scan reaches its safety limit or cannot classify every candidate file, the response adds `"truncated": true` and the persisted counts are lower bounds. Missing storage returns zero persisted counts. The plural route uses the same workspace selector and trust policy as the plural session catalog; an untrusted primary still returns `403 untrusted_workspace`.

The TypeScript daemon SDK exposes the plural route through `workspaceById(...)` or `workspaceByCwd(...)`, followed by `getWorkspaceSessionInfo()`.

### `GET /workspace/:id/sessions` and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions`

List sessions whose canonical workspace matches `:id` or `:workspace`. The path parameter first resolves as an exact workspace id and then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd. Primary workspaces include the existing persisted/live merge: the default list is active sessions from `chats/`; pass `archiveState=archived` to list archived sessions from `chats/archive/`. Trusted non-primary workspaces include active persisted sessions from their own `chats/` store and merge matching live summaries without duplicates; if no active persisted sessions exist, the route preserves the previous live-only cursor behavior. Trusted non-primary workspaces also support `archiveState=archived`, the organized `view=organized` list, and `group` filters, reading from their own `chats/`, `chats/archive/`, and session-organization stores; a combined `view=organized&archiveState=archived` query returns only archived sessions without a live merge. Registered untrusted non-primary workspaces support the same list, filter, and pagination shapes but return persisted entries only: the daemon does not query the live bridge or populate pending interactions, turn errors, or client state from the runtime. Persisted defaults such as `clientCount: 0` and `hasActivePrompt: false` remain present for wire compatibility. Missing storage returns an empty list. The plural route still returns `403 { code: "untrusted_workspace" }` for an untrusted primary; legacy primary routes keep their existing compatibility behavior. `archiveState=all` is not supported in v1. Primary and persisted-backed lists keep the existing numeric `cursor` semantics; the no-persisted trusted non-primary live fallback keeps its existing opaque live cursor.

When `workspace_qualified_rest_core` is advertised, workspace-scoped session batch operations, group CRUD, and session organization mutation are available under `/workspaces/:workspace/sessions/{delete,archive,unarchive}`, `/workspaces/:workspace/session-groups`, and `/workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/organization`. For an untrusted secondary, group GET remains available; every group, session, and organization mutation remains trust-gated. Workspace-less batch and organization mutation routes remain primary-workspace-only for compatibility.

Response:

```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionId": "<uuid>",
      "workspaceCwd": "/canonical/path",
      "createdAt": "2026-05-17T08:30:00.000Z",
      "displayName": "My Session",
      "clientCount": 2,
      "hasActivePrompt": false,
      "isArchived": false
    }
  ],
  "nextCursor": 1772251200000
}
```

With `view=organized`, the daemon reads `<Storage.getProjectDir(cwd)>/session-organization.v1.json`, returns pinned sessions first, then activity time descending, and then `sessionId` for stable ties. The organized cursor is opaque base64url JSON and must not be reused with the legacy recent list. `pinned` is a virtual filter, not a group. `groupId: null` means ungrouped. Archived sessions keep their organization metadata, but `archiveState=archived&view=organized` still returns only archived sessions.

Activity-ordered cursors — the organized view and the `parentSessionId` / `sourceType` filtered lists — are not snapshot-isolated, and a trusted active list orders rows by the later of the transcript mtime and the live activity watermark. A live watermark is in-memory only, so a session's key can regress to its mtime when the live entry retires between two page fetches. The cursor compensates: it carries the identities already emitted at a live-derived key — retaining them while the row is absent from a page's collection and while a pin flip could re-admit them — and excludes them for the rest of the pass, so live-derived key movement returns a session at most once per pass. The guarantee is scoped to the carry: it is bounded at 64 identities (excess identities in one pass degrade to an at-most-once duplicate rather than an error), and a persisted-only row emitted before its pin state changed is never carried, so an unpin between fetches can return that row a second time exactly as before this field existed. Callers that accumulate pages should therefore always key rows by `sessionId`, not only in the over-64 case. Rows can still move or be skipped under concurrent activity, exactly as before; a caller that needs a coherent view reloads from the first page after an activity change.

Additional fields may appear on each session when `view=organized`:

```json
{
  "isPinned": true,
  "pinnedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "groupId": "018f..."
}
```

Trusted active lists include live daemon overlay fields such as `clientCount`, `hasActivePrompt`, and `activeWorkState`. Untrusted-secondary and archived lists are storage-only: live overlay fields remain absent or false, and archived entries set `isArchived` to `true`. Empty array (not 404) when no sessions exist — a session-picker UI shouldn't error just because the workspace is idle.

### `POST /sessions/catalog`

Read independently paginated session catalogs for several registered workspaces in one request. Pre-flight `session_catalog_batch` once; older daemons retain the workspace-qualified session-list and group endpoints. Each batch member has persisted-workspace ownership: authentication and request admission are process-global, while each entry resolves and reads only its owning workspace. It never registers a workspace, creates a session, starts ACP, or falls back to the primary runtime.

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    { "workspace": "workspace-a", "cursor": "previous-a-cursor" },
    { "workspace": "/canonical/workspace-b" }
  ],
  "options": {
    "size": 20,
    "archiveState": "active",
    "view": "organized",
    "group": "all"
  },
  "includeGroups": true
}
```

`workspaces` is an ordered array of 1–20 `{ workspace, cursor? }` entries, or `"all"` to select all public registered workspaces. Selectors resolve as exact ids before canonical absolute paths. `all` excludes internal Conversations and removed entries, includes temporarily unavailable entries, and fails if more than 20 entries would be selected; callers must then split explicit selections. An empty public registry returns an empty result. Explicit internal selectors return an entry error without booting the internal runtime.

Shared `options` accept `size` (integer 1–100, default 20), `archiveState`, `view`, `group`, `parentSessionId`, `sourceType`, and `sourceId` with the existing list filters and combinations. `group` and `parentSessionId` are limited to 256 characters. `includeGroups` defaults to false. Each workspace has its own cursor. Batch default pages use activity ordering and opaque cursors, including for live-only sessions; these cursors are not interchangeable with legacy numeric list cursors. Continue with that entry's returned `cwd` and `nextCursor`, preserving the filters. There is no global sort or global pagination cursor.

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    {
      "workspace": "workspace-a",
      "workspaceId": "workspace-a",
      "cwd": "/canonical/workspace-a",
      "sessions": [],
      "groups": {
        "groups": [],
        "colorOptions": ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
      }
    },
    {
      "workspace": "/canonical/workspace-b",
      "error": {
        "code": "workspace_not_found",
        "message": "Workspace is not registered with this daemon.",
        "status": 404
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The result preserves selection order and the original selector as `workspace`. Successful entries include canonical `cwd`, `workspaceId`, and the existing page fields (`sessions`, optional `nextCursor`, `truncated`, and `liveMergeFailed`). Every returned session's `workspaceCwd` is normalized to its enclosing entry's canonical `cwd`. When requested, `groups` contains the complete group catalog; group identities are scoped to their enclosing workspace. Group reads retain the existing normalization and warn-and-empty fallback for malformed or unreadable organization stores. Failed entries contain `error: { code, message, status }` and resolved identity when available, without a successful empty `sessions` list. Valid batches return HTTP 200 even when some entries fail. Malformed request envelopes return HTTP 400 before storage reads.

Unknown, internal, and removed workspaces produce `404 workspace_not_found`; unavailable or changed runtime generations produce `503 workspace_runtime_unavailable`; an untrusted primary produces `403 untrusted_workspace`. Untrusted secondaries keep the existing persisted-only catalog policy without live bridge reads, repair writes, or debug-session logging. Thrown cursor and group failures retain their existing codes; other thrown read failures become `500 session_catalog_failed`. Trusted active entries can merge existing live bridge state; archived entries remain storage-only.

The daemon runs at most four workspace reads concurrently per batch, limits selectors to 4096 characters and cursors to 16384 characters, and caps each serialized successful entry at 512 KiB. An oversized entry returns `413 catalog_response_too_large`; reduce `size` or omit groups before retrying. This bounds a batch response to approximately 10 MiB plus envelope/error overhead. Client disconnect cancels pending reads and prevents additional workspace reads from starting. The existing daemon JSON body limit and persisted scan limits also apply. Catalog requests use the read rate-limit tier.

### `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions/live-state`

Return the selected workspace runtime's memory-only live-session snapshot plus an in-memory catalog version, so clients can stop polling the persisted catalog at `GET /workspaces/:workspace/sessions` for volatile state such as `hasActivePrompt`, waiting flags, and `clientCount`. Pre-flight `workspace_session_live_state`; the tag is independent of `workspace_qualified_rest_core`, so older daemons advertising the broader workspace REST capability do not implement this route. The selector resolves as exact workspace id first, then as a URL-encoded absolute cwd after canonicalization, matching the other plural session routes. The route is trusted-only for primary and secondary runtimes alike: it never falls back to the primary runtime, and it does not use the permissive persisted-catalog policy that grants an untrusted secondary bounded catalog reads. The endpoint has no query parameters and performs no session storage, settings, external command, or ACP round trips, so its cost is independent of persisted session count and JSONL size; the default live-session cap keeps the response bounded, and with the cap disabled cost stays proportional only to the number of live sessions.

Response:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "catalogVersion": {
    "generation": "7eca3164-bce1-4f50-94d8-c842c480f213",
    "revision": 17
  },
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionId": "session-123",
      "clientCount": 1,
      "hasActivePrompt": true,
      "activeWorkState": "active",
      "isWaitingForPermission": false,
      "isWaitingForUserQuestion": false,
      "updatedAt": "2026-08-18T08:12:30.123Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

`v` is the response schema version. Every successful response includes `Cache-Control: no-store`. `sessions` is the complete, unpaginated, unordered set of sessions currently live in the selected runtime; an empty live runtime returns `200` with `sessions: []`. `clientCount`, `hasActivePrompt`, `isWaitingForPermission`, and `isWaitingForUserQuestion` are required wire fields, and missing optional bridge values project to `0` or `false`. `activeWorkState` is wire-additive and absent on older daemons: `active` means the daemon owns unsettled work or the child sent a fresh non-empty hold snapshot; `idle` is emitted only for a fresh empty snapshot covering every required category; `unknown` means negotiated reporting is stale or incomplete; and `unsupported` means the child did not negotiate reporting. It does not change `hasActivePrompt`: a background shell, cron turn, or pending terminal notification is active work without becoming a foreground prompt. Static catalog fields such as display name, creation time, organization, and source metadata are deliberately excluded and remain owned by the full catalog. An absent live-state row only clears a known catalog row's volatile fields; it never deletes a persisted catalog row.

`updatedAt` is an optional daemon-observed activity watermark, present when a prompt that reached the running state has published a formal terminal in the current bridge. It advances exactly once per such terminal — success, error, cancellation, and deadline alike — is written before the terminal event is published, and is strictly increasing per live session even when two terminals land in one wall-clock millisecond or the wall clock moves backward; a forward clock jump therefore persists until wall time catches up. It is never earlier than the session's `createdAt`: the first advance floors at creation time, so a wall-clock rollback between creation and the first terminal cannot key a row behind the `createdAt` it was already listed at. Prompt admission, queue waits, streamed updates, queue-only cancellation, heartbeats, and interaction waits never advance it. Clients use it to refresh the recency of a catalog row they already hold instead of reloading the full catalog after a completed turn. It is not a persistence acknowledgement: the recorder writes turn results asynchronously, so the value proves only that the daemon observed a running attempt settle. It is absent before the first running terminal in a bridge generation — including for a session restored from disk — so absence is not a support probe, and it disappears when a daemon restart or workspace runtime replacement installs a new bridge. When both a live and a persisted summary exist for one session, full catalog responses report the later valid timestamp, so `GET /session/:id/status`, which returns the bridge summary directly without that merge, may report an earlier value than a list response.

`catalogVersion` is an equality token for daemon-observed catalog changes. `generation` is a random UUID created with each bridge instance and changes on daemon restart or workspace runtime replacement; `revision` starts at zero and increases monotonically within a generation. The only supported operation is equality over the whole pair: same generation and revision means no daemon-observed catalog change, and any difference means reload the full catalog. Clients must not perform revision arithmetic or compare revisions across generations, and conservative extra increments are allowed. The version covers catalog membership and static metadata changes observed by the daemon; ordinary turn activity, prompt lifecycle, attach/detach, and waiting-state transitions do not advance it because the live snapshot already carries the corresponding volatile fields. A changed `updatedAt` under an unchanged version is therefore valid and expected, and it does not invalidate the daemon's persisted-list caches. Two volatile overlay values are deliberately outside both signals: turn-error state (`hasTurnError`/`turnError`) and the pending-interaction count/content (`pendingInteractionCount`/`pendingInteractions`) neither advance the version nor appear in the snapshot, so a client that needs them must keep reading the per-session event stream or the full catalog rather than relying on this route; either field can be added wire-additively when a concrete consumer requires it. Mutations written directly by another daemon, a TUI, or an external process are not observed, so once a client stops periodic full-catalog polling those writes have no bounded discovery time and surface only after an explicit full reload, another observed catalog mutation, reconnect, or daemon/runtime replacement.

Clients reconcile a catalog bundle with a two-read handshake: read live-state A, load the full session list (plus `GET /workspaces/:workspace/session-groups` when the client consumes `session_organization`), then read live-state B. Equal A and B versions accept the bundle; differing versions mark the catalog stale and coalesce at most one trailing reload rather than entering a tight retry loop. Every accepted catalog request must be initiated after A — a request or deduplicated promise that began before A cannot satisfy the reconciliation. Version-driven reloads are single-flight per workspace and obey a non-zero background minimum interval, so sustained catalog churn cannot drive one full catalog scan per live-state poll; explicit local mutations may still request an immediate refresh through the same single-flight operation.

**Errors:**

- `400` — existing selector-validation or `workspace_mismatch` behavior for an unknown, malformed, nested, or unregistered selector; the route never resolves an unknown selector to the primary runtime.
- `403` — `untrusted_workspace` for any untrusted runtime, including an untrusted primary.
- `503` — `workspace_runtime_unavailable` with `Retry-After` for a bootstrapping, transitioning, draining, blocked, or removed runtime, or a runtime generation that closes mid-request.
- `500` — unexpected local errors use the existing bridge error mapping.

### `GET /workspace/:id/session-groups`

List user-defined session groups for a workspace. The singular GET selector accepts any registered workspace id or URL-encoded canonical cwd. The plural GET alias is also available to an untrusted secondary and reads only the organization sidecar. Plural group mutations remain trust-gated, while singular group mutations retain their primary-only compatibility behavior. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`.

Response:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "018f...",
      "name": "Frontend",
      "color": "blue",
      "order": 0,
      "createdAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "colorOptions": ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]
}
```

Colors are protocol tokens only; clients localize display names. No default color-named groups are created.

### `POST /workspace/:id/session-groups`

Create a custom session group. Strict mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`.

Request:

```json
{ "name": "Frontend", "color": "blue" }
```

`name` is trimmed, must be 1-64 characters, cannot contain control characters, and is unique within the workspace by case-insensitive trimmed comparison. Duplicate names return `409 { code: "group_name_conflict" }`. `color` must be one of the returned `colorOptions`.

Response:

```json
{
  "group": {
    "id": "018f...",
    "name": "Frontend",
    "color": "blue",
    "order": 0,
    "createdAt": "...",
    "updatedAt": "..."
  }
}
```

### `PATCH /workspace/:id/session-groups/:groupId`

Update a custom session group. Strict mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`. Body fields are optional: `{ "name"?: string, "color"?: string, "order"?: number }`. Unknown group ids return `404 { code: "group_not_found" }`; duplicate/invalid names and colors use the same errors as create.

### `DELETE /workspace/:id/session-groups/:groupId`

Delete a custom session group. Strict mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`. Sessions referencing the group are cleared to `groupId: null`; pinned state is preserved. Response is `{ "deleted": true }` when a group was removed and `{ "deleted": false }` when the id did not exist.

### `POST /sessions/delete`

Hard-delete one or more persisted session JSONL files. The daemon first best-effort closes live sessions, then removes the active or archived JSONL. If both active and archived copies exist for the same id, both are removed. Worktree sidecars on both sides are cleaned; file history, subagent transcripts, and runtime sidecars are intentionally preserved.

Request:

```json
{ "sessionIds": ["<uuid>"] }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "removed": ["<uuid>"],
  "notFound": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

### `POST /sessions/archive`

Archive one or more sessions. Archive is a state transition, not deletion: the JSONL moves from `chats/<id>.jsonl` to `chats/archive/<id>.jsonl`. File history, subagent transcripts, and runtime sidecars stay in place. If a session is live, the daemon first performs a strict close and requires the ACP agent's close handler to flush the chat recording; if close or flush fails, the JSONL is not moved. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_archive`.

Request:

```json
{ "sessionIds": ["<uuid>"], "resolveConflicts": true }
```

`sessionIds` must be a non-empty string array with at most 100 ids. Duplicates are collapsed.

Response:

```json
{
  "archived": ["<uuid>"],
  "alreadyArchived": [],
  "resolvedConflicts": ["<uuid>"],
  "notFound": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

`resolveConflicts` is optional and defaults to `false`. By default, active and archived files with the same id are reported in `errors`, and neither copy is moved, removed, or overwritten. Archiving a live session still performs the strict close described above before classifying the conflict, so that close may flush queued records to the active transcript. With `resolveConflicts: true`, archive repairs the conflict only when both copies are regular transcript files that the selected workspace may maintain, including owned empty or damaged transcripts. It keeps the archived copy, removes the active copy, and reports the id in both `archived` and `resolvedConflicts`. The option does not bypass ownership checks; mixed local/foreign or otherwise ambiguous ownership is reported in `errors`, and neither copy is moved. `errors` entries have `{ "sessionId": "<uuid>", "error": "message" }`.

An archived-only session is returned in `alreadyArchived` after the daemon acquires a writer or maintenance lease to reconcile pending sidecar cleanup. If another process still holds the writer lease, the archived-only id is reported in `errors` until the lease becomes available.

The transcript move or conflict repair is not rolled back if a later cleanup ownership check fails. In that case the id may appear only in `errors`, even though the archive state already changed, and may be omitted from `archived` and `resolvedConflicts`. Retry the same lifecycle request for the same workspace before treating the error as proof that the active copy or conflict remains. When the service can verify the stored transcript identity and acquire the required writer or maintenance lease, the retry reports the authoritative `alreadyArchived` state even for empty or damaged transcripts that session listing omits, and resumes pending sidecar cleanup. Transcripts whose stored identity cannot be verified continue to report `errors` on retry and require manual inspection; retries that cannot acquire the required lease remain in `errors` until it becomes available.

Lifecycle conflicts are batch item outcomes: the workspace-less and workspace-qualified routes return HTTP `200` with the conflict in `errors`. This replaces the earlier workspace-qualified HTTP `409 session_conflict` envelope; clients that called that route must inspect the batch response. Internal-runtime REST batches preserve the safe conflict message while continuing to redact other per-session failure details.

### `POST /sessions/unarchive`

Restore archived sessions to the active directory. This does not resume the session by itself; it only moves `chats/archive/<id>.jsonl` back to `chats/<id>.jsonl`. After unarchive succeeds, clients may call `POST /session/:id/load` or `POST /session/:id/resume`.

Request:

```json
{ "sessionIds": ["<uuid>"], "resolveConflicts": true }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "unarchived": ["<uuid>"],
  "alreadyActive": [],
  "resolvedConflicts": ["<uuid>"],
  "notFound": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

`resolveConflicts` is optional and defaults to `false`. By default, simultaneous active and archived JSONL files produce a conflict in `errors`, and neither copy is moved, removed, or overwritten; an active-only session is returned in `alreadyActive` after the daemon acquires a writer or maintenance lease to reconcile pending sidecar cleanup. If a live session still holds the writer lease, the active-only id is reported in `errors` until that session closes. With `resolveConflicts: true`, unarchive repairs the conflict only when both copies are regular transcript files that the selected workspace may maintain, including owned empty or damaged transcripts. It keeps the active copy, removes the archived copy, and reports the id in both `unarchived` and `resolvedConflicts`. The option does not bypass ownership checks; mixed local/foreign or otherwise ambiguous ownership is reported in `errors`, and neither copy is moved. Archive or unarchive in flight for the same id returns `409 session_archiving` before starting the batch.

The transcript move or conflict repair is not rolled back if a later cleanup ownership check fails. In that case the id may appear only in `errors`, even though the archive state already changed, and may be omitted from `unarchived` and `resolvedConflicts`. Retry the same lifecycle request for the same workspace before treating the error as proof that the archived copy or conflict remains. When the service can verify the stored transcript identity and acquire the required writer or maintenance lease, the retry reports the authoritative `alreadyActive` state even for empty or damaged transcripts that session listing omits, and resumes pending sidecar cleanup. Transcripts whose stored identity cannot be verified continue to report `errors` on retry and require manual inspection; retries that cannot acquire the required lease, including because an active session still holds it, remain in `errors` until the lease becomes available.

ACP-over-HTTP uses the same request and response bodies through vendor methods `_qwen/sessions/archive` and `_qwen/sessions/unarchive`. The REST route table maps `POST /sessions/archive` and `POST /sessions/unarchive` to those methods for ACP transports.

### Multi-workspace live-session routing

When `multi_workspace_sessions` is advertised, live-session operations identify their workspace from the `sessionId`; clients do not add a workspace selector to the URL. In addition to the existing owner-routed lifecycle operations, this applies to `PATCH /session/:id/metadata`, `POST /session/:id/recap`, `POST /session/:id/generate`, `POST /session/:id/btw`, `POST /session/:id/mid-turn-message`, `GET /session/:id/mid-turn-messages`, `DELETE /session/:id/mid-turn-messages/:messageId`, `POST /session/:id/tasks/:taskId/cancel`, `POST /session/:id/goal/clear`, `POST /session/:id/continue`, `POST /session/:id/language`, `POST /session/:id/artifacts`, `DELETE /session/:id/artifacts/:artifactId`, `GET /session/:id/sources`, `POST /session/:id/sources`, and `DELETE /session/:id/sources/:sourceId`. The daemon routes each request to the trusted runtime that owns the live session. An untrusted non-primary owner returns `403 untrusted_workspace`, a missing live owner returns `404 session_not_found`, and an ambiguous owner fails closed with `500 ambiguous_session_owner`.

This rule is live-session-only and does not make every workspace-less session route multi-workspace-aware. Persisted or archived operations use their documented workspace-qualified routes. `POST /session/:id/branch`, `POST /session/:id/fork`, and `POST /session/:id/cd` intentionally remain primary-only and return `non_primary_session_route_not_supported` for non-primary owners.

### Mid-turn messages

`POST /session/:id/mid-turn-message` accepts `{ "message": "...", "messageId": "<optional-message-id>" }`. A successful admission returns `{ "accepted": true, "messageId": "<id>" }` and transfers ownership to the daemon: the message is drained into the active turn or promoted into the normal prompt FIFO when the session becomes idle. Clients using `session_mid_turn_message_query` send a stable `messageId`; repeating it is idempotent while it remains queued, pending, or in the bounded reconciliation rings. A rejection of a request the daemon validated returns `{ "accepted": false }` and never transfers ownership: an open session with no prompt admitted to its prompt FIFO and no active Goal turn reports `{ "accepted": false, "reason": "session_idle" }` so the client can resubmit the message as an ordinary prompt instead of surfacing a failure. For a genuinely new admission, a `content` block referencing an attachment the session no longer holds — or an invalid reference — is declined before the idle and queue verdicts: the request is answered `410 session_attachment_gone` (or `400 invalid_session_attachment_reference`) with an `{ "error", "code" }` body, which carries no `reason` even when the session is idle. Two earlier gates preempt it: a repeated `messageId` whose payload still matches settles idempotently with `{ "accepted": true, "messageId" }` even if the attachment has since been removed, and a session that is closing or authorizing a close is refused with a reasonless `{ "accepted": false }`. The verdict describes only what can drain a mid-turn message, not everything the session may hold — a session snapshot can still report `hasActivePrompt: true` for it, for example while a deferred restore prompt is parked. A reasonless rejection has another cause — the queue is full, the session is closing or authorizing a close, the queued inline-attachment budget is exhausted, or a repeated `messageId` no longer matches the payload the daemon holds. The daemon keeps the payload it already admitted rather than replacing it, but that is not a delivery promise: a promoted message the client removed disappears from pending-prompt snapshots at once — one that had not started is dropped where it stands, one already running is hidden until its aborted turn settles — so the removal response is the only `removed = true` a client ever observes. A closing session never promotes what remains queued, and a turn that settles while a close is still being authorized hands the queue to the admission gate, which refuses it, so those messages are dropped rather than promoted and land in no ring. A close the child then refuses leaves the session live with whatever remained queued still listed and nothing scheduled to promote it until some later turn ends. Those messages are still the daemon's, so the default recovery is to wait: the next turn's settle promotes the backlog, nothing is lost and nothing is delivered twice. A client that cannot wait — no further turn is coming and the user is watching a queue that will not drain — may force the drain instead, and the only supported way is to release each payload before sending it again. Both paths start from the same set: build it from the client's own record of what it enqueued during that window minus whatever it has positive delivery evidence for, not from the listing's silence. The query is not an inventory of what the daemon holds — it omits a prompt already marked removed, both rings are bounded, and an enqueue sent without a client id is not tracked on this surface at all — so an id reported nowhere may have aged out after delivery, been dropped undelivered, or never been listed. Positive delivery evidence is a `mid_turn_message_injected` echo, a `pending_prompt_started` for that id, or membership in either ring.

The mid-turn POST also accepts optional `eventDetailMode`: `full` (default) or
`summary`; invalid values return `400 invalid_event_detail_mode`. The daemon
retains this mode with the message and uses it if an undrained message becomes
a new prompt. Draining into an existing turn does not change that turn's mode.
While queued or promoted-and-pending, a retry under the same `messageId` must
match text, media and effective mode (omitted equals full). Web Shell sends its
current Provider mode. The REST route still rejects new idle admissions with
`reason: "session_idle"`; callers then submit an ordinary prompt.

To force the drain, `DELETE /session/:id/mid-turn-messages/:messageId` every id in that set which the query still reports as queued, and only then post the text again under a new `messageId`, because a repeated id is acked idempotently and re-arms nothing. The order matters and applies to the whole set rather than one id at a time: a still-queued payload the daemon owns is promoted by the next settle, so re-posting an id whose payload was never released delivers that message twice — once from that promotion and once from the resend. Where `session_mid_turn_message_mutation` is not advertised there is no way to release a payload, so waiting is the only safe option. No DELETE verdict establishes delivery on its own. `{ "removed": false }` covers an id already injected or completed — delivered, so it must not be re-posted — and, per the DELETE route below, an id not found, which for one the query had just listed as queued means it left the queue between the two calls and may have been dropped undelivered by the close-authorization path above; decide that case from the client's own evidence. `{ "removed": true }` releases the payload, but for an id a settle promoted in that window it covers both a FIFO entry spliced before it ever dispatched, which is safe to re-post, and an abort of a promoted prompt that had already started, which a re-post then sends a second time. A promoted id also stays deletable through the same route until it settles, even though the listing no longer reports it as queued. The re-post itself is a mid-turn admission and can be refused `{ "accepted": false, "reason": "session_idle" }`; that is not a failure but the signal described above that the session now takes an ordinary prompt, and submitting through the ordinary route starts a turn whose settle promotes whatever is still queued — which is the same reason every id in the set has to be released first.

A missing `reason` is therefore not evidence of a busy session. Daemons that predate `reason` omit it in every case, so clients keep their own idle detection alongside it. New clients connected to an older daemon detect the missing capability and retain their legacy local fallback.

`GET /session/:id/mid-turn-messages` returns the session-wide daemon-owned queue plus bounded `settledMessageIds` and `promotedMessageIds` rings. Settled ids were injected or explicitly deleted; promoted ids entered the normal prompt FIFO. An id in either ring must not be resent.

When a queued message is drained into the active turn, the daemon publishes `mid_turn_message_injected` carrying aligned `messages` and `messageIds` arrays (and the running turn's `promptId` when known). It is a transient dedupe signal, not a transcript item: clients settle completion callbacks registered under those message ids and drop any local pending rows for them. Older daemons additionally carry `originatorClientId` in the payload. A missed echo is recovered from the settled ring via the query above.

When `session_mid_turn_message_mutation` is advertised, an attached session client may call `DELETE /session/:id/mid-turn-messages/:messageId`. It removes the message from either the mid-turn queue or its promoted pending-prompt state; removing a promoted message that is already running aborts that turn, matching ordinary pending-prompt removal. Daemon-owned queue additions and removals publish the existing `pending_prompt_added` and `pending_prompt_completed` session events so attached clients refresh both authoritative queue snapshots. `{ "removed": false }` means the message was already injected, completed, or not found.

### `GET /session/:id/pending-prompts`

Return the currently running prompt and the prompts waiting in the live
session's FIFO. The request may include `X-Qwen-Client-Id`; when present it must
identify an attached client.

```json
{
  "pendingPrompts": [
    {
      "promptId": "<prompt-id>",
      "text": "Explain the failure",
      "queuedAt": 1700000000123,
      "state": "running",
      "originatorClientId": "<client-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```

`state` is `running` for the prompt being dispatched and `queued` for waiting
prompts. `content` appears when the prompt includes structured content such as
images. This is a live-session-owner route: `404` means no live owner and
`503` means the owner is temporarily unavailable. An untrusted non-primary
owner returns `403 untrusted_workspace`, and an id live in more than one
workspace returns `500 ambiguous_session_owner`. There is no dedicated
capability tag; older daemons return `404`. The TypeScript SDK method is
`getPendingPrompts()`.

### `POST /session/:id/prompt`

`eventDetailMode` accepts `full` (default) or `summary`; invalid values return
`400 invalid_event_detail_mode`. Summary filters nested subagent details before
ring retention and SSE delivery, and removes Agent prompts, embedded tools and
in-progress token counters while preserving root content and main-model usage.
Settled Agent results retain `tokenCount` and `executionSummary` token totals
(including failure/cancellation) for turn metrics; nested usage frames remain
filtered. The same rule applies to summary load/transcript responses. The mode is
captured at admission, applied only at dispatch, and resets to full on settlement.
Late subagent events use the mode at publication: full while idle, or the active
prompt's mode when a subsequent prompt is running. They do not inherit the mode
of the prompt that originally launched the subagent.
It applies to all subscribers of the session; filtered details cannot later be
retrieved from the ring. The daemon's `/acp` `session/prompt` accepts the same
optional top-level extension with the same scope (invalid values are JSON-RPC
`-32602`); it is not a standard ACP field and is not forwarded to the child.

Forward a prompt to the agent. Multi-prompt callers FIFO-queue per session (ACP guarantees one active prompt per session).

Request:

```json
{
  "prompt": [{ "type": "text", "text": "What does src/main.ts do?" }],
  "delivery": {
    "kind": "channel",
    "target": {
      "channelName": "dingtalk",
      "type": "user",
      "id": "platform-user-id"
    }
  }
}
```

`delivery` is optional and requires the `channel_delivery` capability. The
daemon still returns `202 {promptId,lastEventId}` when the prompt is admitted.
After a successful `end_turn`, the session submits the visible final text to
the exact workspace's already-running Channel Worker. The payload is only the
last tool-free assistant response block; tool-call preambles, inter-tool
narration, superseded retries, and earlier automatic-continuation blocks are
excluded. An empty or whitespace-only final still produces a correlated
`channel_delivery_result` with `status: "skipped"` after authorization is
consumed, but it does not contact a worker. Delivery success or failure arrives
later through the same replayable event and never changes `turn_complete` into
`turn_error`. Cancellation, Agent failure, and token-limit termination do not
send or publish a delivery result.

Validation: `prompt` must be a non-empty array of objects. Other failures return `400` before reaching the bridge.

Response:

```json
{ "promptId": "session-id########1", "lastEventId": 42 }
```

The `202` response acknowledges admission, not Agent completion. Observe the
session SSE stream after `lastEventId` and correlate `turn_complete` or
`turn_error` by `promptId`.

`turn_complete.data.stopReason` carries the ACP `StopReason` the agent
returned — `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, `max_turn_requests`, `refusal` or
`cancelled`. The daemon can also emit `cancelled` for a prompt aborted without
the agent running it, including queued-prompt removal, caller disconnect, or
drain/teardown; that value does not prove the agent ran the prompt. **Treat the
field as an open string**: it is typed `string` on the wire, the ACP set can
grow, and a client that exhaustively switches on it will break on the next
addition.

Two daemon-side outcomes do **not** arrive on this field. A turn that fails
inside the daemon — deadline expiry, teardown flush, child crash — is published
as a `turn_error` event, never as a `turn_complete` stopReason. Its `data`
always carries `message`; `code` is present only when the daemon classified the
failure (deadline expiry → `prompt_deadline_exceeded`, teardown flush →
`channel_closed`, `session_closed`, `session_killed` or `daemon_shutdown`), and
the frame for a prompt rejected because the ACP child died mid-request carries
neither `code` nor `errorKind`. Treat both as optional and branch on `message`.

A turn recovered from persisted history after a restart is not re-published on
the stream at all; it surfaces in `promptTerminals[]` in the
`POST /session/:id/load` response body — as
`{ terminal: "completed", stopReason: "reconstructed_from_transcript" }` when
the persisted tail shows the turn finished, or
`{ terminal: "interrupted", code: "daemon_lost" }` with **no** `stopReason` when
the daemon died mid-turn. Match the entry by `promptId` and branch on
`terminal`; `promptTerminals` is omitted from the response entirely when the
ledger holds no evidence for the session.

If the HTTP client disconnects mid-prompt, the daemon sends an ACP `cancel` notification to the agent, which winds the prompt down with `stopReason: "cancelled"`.

When `prompt_absolute_deadline` is advertised, `deadlineMs` may shorten the
configured server deadline. Expiry emits a correlated `turn_error` with
`code: "prompt_deadline_exceeded"`. The deadline releases the caller without
killing the agent; if the agent later settles, turn-status polls for that
`promptId` return the settled transcript outcome instead of the deadline error.

### `POST /session/:id/cancel`

Cancel the **currently active** prompt on the session. ACP-side this is a notification, not a request — the agent acknowledges by resolving the active `prompt()` with `cancelled`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4170/session/$SID/cancel
# → 204 No Content
```

> **Multi-prompt contract:** cancel only affects the active prompt. Any prompts the same client previously POSTed and are still queued behind the active one will continue to execute. Multi-prompt queueing is a daemon-introduced behavior (not in ACP spec); the contract for queued prompts is "they keep running unless you cancel each, or kill the session via channel exit".

If queued prompts are unexpected in a multi-client deployment, first confirm
whether callers are sharing a default `sessionScope: "single"` session. For
independent per-thread conversations, create sessions with
`sessionScope: "thread"` so prompts serialize only within that thread.

### `DELETE /session/:id`

Explicitly close a live session. Force-closes even when other clients are attached — cancels any active prompt, resolves pending permissions as cancelled, publishes `session_closed` event, closes the EventBus, and removes the session from daemon maps. On-disk persisted sessions are NOT deleted — they can be reloaded via `POST /session/:id/load`. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_close`.

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:4170/session/$SID
# → 204 No Content
```

Idempotent: returns `404` for unknown sessions. The error envelope uses `code: "session_not_found"`; a concurrent close may return `code: "session_closing"`, which clients may treat as the same successful terminal state for this route.

> **`session_closed` event.** SSE subscribers receive a terminal `session_closed` event with `{ sessionId, reason: 'client_close', closedBy?: '<clientId>' }` before the stream ends. SDK reducers treat this identically to `session_died` (sets `alive: false`, clears `pendingPermissions`).

### `PATCH /session/:id/metadata`

Update mutable session metadata. Pre-flight `caps.features.session_metadata`.
Grouping and pinning are intentionally not part of this route; use
`PATCH /session/:id/organization` under `session_organization`.

Request:

```json
{
  "displayName": "My Investigation Session",
  "pr": {
    "number": 123,
    "url": "https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/123",
    "state": "open"
  }
}
```

| Field         | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `displayName` | no       | String. Values longer than 256 UTF-16 code units are truncated, and the cut is not surrogate-pair aware, so a name ending in a non-BMP character can lose a lone surrogate half. An empty or whitespace-only value is rejected with `400 invalid_metadata`; omit the field to leave the name unchanged. |
| `pr`          | no       | Bind one pull request. Requires a positive integer `number`, an HTTP(S) `url` of at most 2,048 characters without control characters, and optional `state`: `open`, `merged`, or `closed`.                                                                                                              |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "displayName": "My Investigation Session",
  "prs": [
    {
      "number": 123,
      "url": "https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/123",
      "state": "open"
    }
  ]
}
```

`prs` is the effective bounded binding history and may include refreshed issue
links. Publishes a `session_metadata_updated` event on the session's SSE stream
carrying only the field group that changed: a rename emits `displayName` (plus
`titleSource` when the name is set) and leaves `prs` absent, while a PR binding
change emits `prs` and echoes the current `displayName` when one is set. Treat a
field absent from the event as unchanged, not cleared, and re-read the `200` body
or the session list when you need the full metadata.

### `PATCH /session/:id/organization` and `PATCH /workspaces/:workspace/session/:id/organization`

Update local session organization state through the existing mutation gate. Pre-flight `caps.features.includes('session_organization')`; the plural route additionally requires `workspace_qualified_rest_core`. On the plural route, `:workspace` resolves as an exact registered workspace id first and then as a URL-encoded canonical absolute cwd. The selected runtime must be trusted. Session existence and non-null `groupId` validation are scoped to that runtime's active persisted, archived persisted, and live session state and group store, with no fallback to the primary or another workspace. The legacy route remains primary-workspace-only.

Request:

```json
{ "isPinned": true, "groupId": "018f..." }
```

| Field      | Required | Notes                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isPinned` | no       | Boolean. `true` sets `pinnedAt` if it was not already pinned; `false` clears `pinnedAt`.             |
| `groupId`  | no       | Custom group id or `null` for ungrouped. Unknown group ids return `404 { code: "group_not_found" }`. |
| `color`    | no       | A supported session color token, or `null` to clear the session color.                               |

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<uuid>",
  "groupId": "018f...",
  "color": "blue",
  "isPinned": true,
  "pinnedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-07-04T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

This state is stored in the project-level session organization sidecar under the daemon runtime storage directory. It is not transcript content, does not update transcript `mtime`, is not exported with transcripts, and is preserved across archive/unarchive.

### `POST /session/:id/heartbeat`

Bump the daemon's last-seen bookkeeping for this session. Long-lived adapters (TUI/IDE/web) ping this on an interval so future revocation policy (Wave 5 PR 24) can distinguish dead clients from quiet ones.

Headers:

| Header             | Required | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-Qwen-Client-Id` | no       | Echoes the daemon-issued id from `POST /session`. Identified clients also bump their per-client timestamp; anonymous heartbeats only bump the per-session watermark. Must satisfy the same `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{1,128}` shape as elsewhere. |

Request body is empty (`{}` is fine — no fields are read today).

Response:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "<sid>",
  "clientId": "<cid>",
  "lastSeenAt": 1700000000123
}
```

`clientId` is echoed only when a trusted `X-Qwen-Client-Id` was supplied. `lastSeenAt` is the daemon-side `Date.now()` epoch (ms) the bridge stored.

Errors:

- `400` — `{ code: 'invalid_client_id' }` when the header is malformed (header-shape rule) or when it carries a `clientId` that isn't registered for this session (the bridge throws `InvalidClientIdError` before bumping any timestamp).
- `404` — unknown session.

Capability gating: pre-flight `caps.features.client_heartbeat`. Older daemons return `404` for this path.

### `POST /session/:id/model`

Switch the active model **within** the session's currently bound model service. Serialized through the per-session model-change queue.

(For switching the _service_ itself — Alibaba ModelStudio vs OpenRouter etc — pass `modelServiceId` on `POST /session` for a fresh session. Stage 1 has no live service-switch route.)

Request:

```json
{ "modelId": "qwen-staging" }
```

Response: the ACP agent's model-switch result, forwarded verbatim — the
daemon does not reshape it, so the top level carries no `modelId`. Read the
switch details from `_meta.qwenModelSwitch`.

On success, publishes `model_switched` to the SSE stream. On failure, publishes `model_switch_failed` (so passive subscribers see the failure, not just the caller). Races against the agent channel exit so a wedged child can't block the HTTP handler. A successful switch also records the session model in the session JSONL on a best-effort basis; when the record is written, daemon load/resume attempts to restore this session's model before authentication. If the recorded model can no longer be applied (model removed, credentials unavailable), restore uses a same-id registry route when one exists — for a runtime-snapshot record that can be a different endpoint than the recorded binding — and continues on the `settings.model.name` default only when no route resolves. `settings.model.name` is still updated as the default for **new** sessions.

### `POST /session/:id/recap`

Capability tag: `session_recap`. Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/session/recap`.

Generate a one-sentence "where did I leave off" summary of the session. Wraps core's `generateSessionRecap` (`packages/core/src/services/sessionRecap.ts`), which runs a side-query against the fast model with tools disabled, `maxOutputTokens: 300`, and a strict `<recap>...</recap>` output format. The side-query reads the session's existing GeminiClient chat history and does **not** add to it.

Request body is ignored (send `{}` or empty). Non-strict mutation gate — posture mirrors `/session/:id/prompt` (the call costs tokens but mutates no state). No SSE event is published.

Response (200):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess:42",
  "recap": "Debugging the auth retry race. Next: add deterministic timing to the integration test."
}
```

`recap` is `null` (a normal 200, not an error) when:

- the session has fewer than two dialog turns yet,
- the side-query returned no extractable `<recap>...</recap>` payload,
- or any underlying model error occurred (the core helper is best-effort and never throws).

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_client_id'}` — malformed `X-Qwen-Client-Id` header.
- `404` — session unknown.

Cancellation: **none in v1**. The route does not listen for HTTP client disconnect, no `AbortSignal` is plumbed into the bridge, and the ACP child runs the side-query to completion regardless of whether the caller has disconnected. The only ceilings are the bridge's 60s backstop timeout (`SESSION_RECAP_TIMEOUT_MS`) and the transport-closed race against ACP channel death. This is acceptable because recap is short (single-attempt, `maxOutputTokens: 300`, ~1–5s typical); a request-id-based cancel ext-method can plumb full end-to-end cancellation in a future release if the bandwidth cost ever justifies it.

### `POST /session/:id/generate`

Capability tag: `session_generation`.

Run request-scoped text generation from a caller-supplied prompt. The request
does not read or mutate conversation history and exposes no tools. It prefers
the configured fast model, falling back to the session's main model if the fast
model is missing or cannot be resolved. The endpoint is task-agnostic;
translation is only one possible caller-defined prompt.

Request:

```json
{ "prompt": "Translate into Chinese: Hello" }
```

The response is `text/event-stream`. The server writes an initial SSE comment
immediately, followed by `started`, an optional `thinking` progress event, zero
or more `delta` events, and `done`. The `thinking` event carries no reasoning
content. A model failure after streaming starts produces an `error` event; it
does not retry with another model. Prompts are limited to 32 KiB of UTF-8 text.
Disconnecting the HTTP client cancels the generation request.

### Mutation: approval, tools, skills, init, MCP restart

The daemon exposes five mutation control routes that let remote clients change runtime posture without touching the daemon host's CLI. Approval-mode control retains its non-strict compatibility gate. Tool toggle, skill toggle, workspace init, and MCP restart use the strict mutation gate: trusted-loopback primary, bearer-authenticated, and paired Local Control requests pass. A token-less primary request that reaches the gate without trusted-loopback authority receives `401 {code: 'token_required'}`; missing or invalid configured credentials and unpaired Local Control credentials are rejected earlier with plain `401 Unauthorized`. All five:

- Accept and stamp the `X-Qwen-Client-Id` header (PR 7 audit chain). When the header carries a trusted id, the daemon emits `originatorClientId` on the corresponding SSE event so cross-client UIs can suppress echoes of their own mutations.
- Pre-flight each per-tag capability before exposing the affordance. A daemon that lacks a route returns `404`. For the Skill settings routes, tag absence can instead mean that the same paths serve the retired catalog-validated contract: the single-target route can return HTTP `404 skill_not_found` or `409 skill_not_toggleable`, while the batch route returns HTTP 200 with catalog-derived failures in `errors[]`. Do not use route probing as the version check.

The tool toggle, skill toggle, init, and MCP restart routes emit **workspace-scoped** events: every active session SSE bus receives the event, regardless of which session was attached when the mutation was triggered. `approval-mode` emits a **session-scoped** event because the change is local to one session's `Config`.

#### `POST /session/:id/approval-mode`

Capability tag: `session_approval_mode_control`. Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/session/approval_mode`.

Change the approval mode of a live session. The new mode lands inside the ACP child's per-session `Config` immediately. Settings are NOT written to disk by default — pass `persist: true` to also write `tools.approvalMode` to workspace settings.

Request:

```json
{ "mode": "auto-edit", "persist": false }
```

`mode` must be one of `'plan' | 'default' | 'auto-edit' | 'auto' | 'yolo'` (mirror of core's `ApprovalMode` enum; the SDK exports `DAEMON_APPROVAL_MODES` for runtime validation). `persist` defaults to `false`.

Response (200):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "sess:42",
  "mode": "auto-edit",
  "previous": "default",
  "persisted": false
}
```

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_approval_mode', allowed: [...]}` — unknown mode literal.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_persist_flag'}` — `persist` is non-boolean.
- `403 {code: 'trust_gate', errorKind: 'auth_env_error'}` — the requested mode requires a trusted folder (privileged modes in untrusted workspaces are rejected by core's `Config.setApprovalMode`).
- `404` — session unknown.

SSE event (session-scoped): `approval_mode_changed` with `{sessionId, previous, next, persisted, originatorClientId?}`.

#### `POST /workspace/tools/:name/enable`

Capability tag: `workspace_tool_toggle`. Pure file IO — no ACP roundtrip.

Toggle a tool name in the workspace's `tools.disabled` settings list. Tools listed there are **not registered** at all (distinct from `permissions.deny`, which keeps the tool registered and rejects invocation). Both built-in tools and MCP-discovered tools flow through `ToolRegistry.registerTool`, which consults the disabled set.

> ⚠️ **Names must match the registry's exposed identifier exactly.** No alias resolution happens — the route stores whatever string is in the path parameter into `tools.disabled`, and the next ACP child compares against `tool.name` at register time. Built-ins use their canonical registry name (snake_case verb form): `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `glob`, `grep_search`, `web_fetch`, etc. — NOT the display labels (`Shell`, `Read`, `Write`) that the CLI surfaces. MCP-discovered tools use the qualified `mcp__<server>__<name>` form (which is also the form `tool_toggled` events broadcast and what `GET /workspace/mcp` lists). Disabling `Bash` will NOT prevent `run_shell_command` from registering on the next session.

Live ACP children retain already-registered tools — the toggle takes effect on the **next** ACP child spawn. Combine with `POST /workspace/mcp/:server/restart` (for MCP-sourced tools) or new-session creation to make the change effective in the current daemon.

Unknown tool names are accepted: pre-disabling a not-yet-installed MCP tool is a legitimate use case.

Request:

```json
{ "enabled": false }
```

Response (200):

```json
{ "toolName": "run_shell_command", "enabled": false }
```

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_tool_name'}` — empty path parameter, or path parameter exceeds the 256-character cap.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_enabled_flag'}` — `enabled` missing or non-boolean.

SSE event (workspace-scoped): `tool_toggled` with `{toolName, enabled, originatorClientId?}`.

#### Split Skills config and runtime routes

Capability tag: `workspace_skills_config_runtime`.

`GET /workspace/config/skills` reads the daemon-local global configuration owner. `GET /workspaces/:workspace/config/skills` reads the exact registered workspace configuration and does not require a live or trusted runtime. Both return the normal Skills status shape without a required `runtimeEpoch`:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/work/project",
  "initialized": true,
  "skills": []
}
```

`GET /workspace/runtime/skills` and `GET /workspaces/:workspace/runtime/skills` read the selected trusted runtime without starting it. A live catalog includes the runtime generation that produced it:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/work/project",
  "initialized": true,
  "runtimeEpoch": 4,
  "skills": []
}
```

Global installation and deletion use `POST /workspace/config/skills/install` and `DELETE /workspace/config/skills/:name?scope=global`. Workspace installation, deletion, and enablement use `POST /workspaces/:workspace/config/skills/install`, `DELETE /workspaces/:workspace/config/skills/:name?scope=workspace`, and `POST /workspaces/:workspace/config/skills/:name/enable`. Config writes commit durable state before scheduling runtime reconciliation. Their `activation` is `deferred` when no current runtime can be updated and `reconciling` when an update has been queued; a no-op toggle preserves the facade's activation instead of claiming that a runtime refresh occurred.

Config deletion returns `503 skills_config_unavailable` instead of a definitive not-found response when the daemon-local Skill inventory cannot be enumerated.

The singular mutation owner rejects workspace scope with `400 workspace_scope_requires_qualified_workspace`; qualified mutations reject global scope with `400 global_scope_requires_singular_owner`. Qualified writes require a trusted workspace. A legacy injected bridge returns `501 workspace_runtime_not_supported` for qualified config writes that require runtime coordination. Unknown, removed, transitioning, and draining workspaces follow the standard qualified-workspace errors and never fall back to primary.

#### `POST /workspace/skills/:name/enable`

Capability tag: `workspace_skill_settings_toggle`. The workspace-qualified form is `POST /workspaces/:workspace/skills/:name/enable`.

Update the workspace Skill settings for a name without consulting the loaded Skill catalog. The trimmed request name is passed to persistence and returned in the response. Enabling any name records a workspace `skills.enabled` opt-in, even before installation; disabling removes that opt-in and adds a workspace `skills.disabled` entry. Existing entries for Skills that are no longer loaded are preserved, and duplicate/case-variant entries for the target are collapsed. A hard `skills.disabled` entry inherited from a higher scope remains authoritative for effective availability, but does not prevent the workspace scope from recording or removing its own declaration. Workspace declarations otherwise participate in the usual `skills.disabled > skills.enabled > skills.defaultDisabled` resolution and can override higher-scope `skills.defaultDisabled` or `skills.enabled` entries.

This is different from the ACP `qwen/skills/setEnabled` managed-skill operation and the `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter field. For an active Extension parent, effective Skill availability follows `skills.disabled` > `skills.enabled` > `skills.defaultDisabled` > workspace internal override > manifest `skillStates` > enabled. Both hard and default disables remove the skill from slash-command/model availability and reject later skill execution. `disable-model-invocation: true` keeps direct user invocation available and only hides the skill from model invocation.

Request:

```json
{ "enabled": false }
```

Response (200):

```json
{
  "skillName": "review",
  "enabled": false,
  "changed": true,
  "activation": "applied",
  "sessionsRefreshed": 2,
  "sessionsFailed": 0
}
```

`activation` reflects child liveness and any required refresh independently from `changed`. It is `applied` when an ACP child is live and any required refresh succeeds, `deferred` when no child was live at the liveness check or a changed request loses its child/session during the required refresh, and `partial` when at least one other required refresh fails. A no-op can therefore be `applied` or `deferred` with `changed: false`; when `changed` is true and activation is `deferred`, the persisted declaration is used when a child starts. Busy sessions are included in a required refresh. The daemon reloads workspace settings for the ACP child and every active session, notifies SkillManager consumers, and pushes `available_commands_update`. A request already sent to the model is not rewritten; subsequent validation, command snapshots, and model contexts use the new state. If persistence fails, no refresh or event is emitted. If a session refresh fails, the committed setting is retained. When the child returns per-session results, the session counts are exact. If the refresh control itself fails before returning those results, `sessionsFailed: 1` is a conservative lower bound indicating that the refresh request failed.

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_skill_name'}` — empty path parameter, or more than 256 characters.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_enabled_flag'}` — `enabled` missing or non-boolean.
- `403 {code: 'untrusted_workspace'}` — the selected workspace is not trusted.

The mutation reuses the workspace-scoped `settings_changed` event for each changed key (`skills.disabled` and/or `skills.enabled`); it does not add a new event type. Each of those events includes the same `mutation` object: `{ id, kind: 'skill_toggle', skills: [{ name, enabled }], activation, sessionsRefreshed, sessionsFailed }`. `id` correlates every settings event produced by one toggle request. `skills` lists the requested names and requested enabled values whose workspace settings declarations actually changed; a higher-scope setting can leave effective availability unchanged. Workspace skill status cells include optional `disabledReason: 'hard' | 'default' | 'inactive_extension'` and `lockedScope: 'system' | 'user' | 'systemDefaults'` fields.

#### `POST /workspace/skills/enable`

Capability tag: `workspace_skill_settings_batch_toggle`. The workspace-qualified form is `POST /workspaces/:workspace/skills/enable`.

Update workspace Skill settings for up to 100 names in one request; the cap counts the raw `skillNames` entries before deduplication. Names are trimmed and deduplicated case-insensitively while preserving first-seen order and casing. The daemon does not consult the loaded Skill catalog. It applies all resulting declaration changes in at most one locked settings write and, when anything changed, refreshes active sessions once. Enabling always records an explicit workspace `skills.enabled` opt-in, including names not yet installed, so it can override an Extension's internal disablement. Repeating an identical declaration remains a no-op. Unexpected persistence or runtime-generation failures fail the whole request.

Request:

```json
{
  "skillNames": ["review", "deploy", "missing"],
  "enabled": false
}
```

Response (200):

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "activation": "applied",
  "sessionsRefreshed": 2,
  "sessionsFailed": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "skillName": "review",
      "enabled": false,
      "changed": true
    },
    {
      "skillName": "deploy",
      "enabled": false,
      "changed": true
    },
    {
      "skillName": "missing",
      "enabled": false,
      "changed": true
    }
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

Malformed requests return HTTP 400 with `invalid_skill_names`, `invalid_skill_name`, or `invalid_enabled_flag`. Authentication, workspace trust, client identity, unexpected persistence failures, and runtime-generation failures fail the whole request through the standard route gates. `errors` remains in the response for wire compatibility and is empty for structurally valid names. Batch-level `activation`, `sessionsRefreshed`, and `sessionsFailed` describe child liveness and the single live-session refresh shared by all changed results. A batch in which no target changed can still answer `applied` when a child is live or `deferred` when none exists, matching the single-Skill no-op response, so derive what actually changed from each result's `changed` flag. When at least one target changes, the daemon emits the same `settings_changed` mutation metadata as the single-Skill route; every `skills.disabled` / `skills.enabled` event from that request shares one `mutation.id`.

#### `POST /workspace/init`

Capability tag: `workspace_init`. Pure file IO — no ACP roundtrip, **no LLM invocation**.

Scaffold an empty `QWEN.md` (or the workspace `context.fileName` settings override) at the daemon's primary workspace root. Mechanical only — for AI-driven content fill, follow up with `POST /session/:id/prompt`.

Default refuses to overwrite when the target file exists with non-whitespace content. Whitespace-only files are treated as absent (matches the local `/init` slash command).

Request:

```json
{ "force": false }
```

Response (200):

```json
{ "path": "/work/bound/QWEN.md", "action": "created" }
```

`action` is `'created'` for fresh creates, `'noop'` when an existing whitespace-only file was left untouched (no write performed), and `'overwrote'` when `force: true` replaced non-empty content. The `workspace_initialized` SSE event mirrors the response action — observers can filter for `action !== 'noop'` to react only to actual on-disk changes.

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_force_flag'}` — `force` is non-boolean.
- `409 {code: 'workspace_init_conflict', path, existingSize}` — file exists with non-whitespace content and `force` is omitted/false. Body carries the absolute path and size (bytes) so SDK clients can render an "overwrite N bytes?" prompt without re-stat'ing.

SSE event (workspace-scoped): `workspace_initialized` with `{path, action, originatorClientId?}`.

#### `POST /workspace/mcp/reload`

Reload persisted MCP settings into the workspace discovery config and every
active session. The workspace-qualified form is
`POST /workspaces/:workspace/mcp/reload`.

Request body:

```json
{ "forceReconnectAll": true }
```

`forceReconnectAll` is optional and defaults to `false`, preserving
incremental reconciliation. When true, the daemon reconnects every eligible
configured MCP server after the settings reconciliation. Alternatively, pass
`forceReconnectWhich: ["server-a", "server-b"]` to reconnect only named
servers. The options are mutually exclusive. A forced reconnect causes each
transport to read credentials that another local Qwen Code process may have
written to token storage; it does not start an OAuth authorization flow.

The route returns `202 { "accepted": true }`; poll `GET /workspace/mcp` for
the final connection status. Invalid option values return 400.

#### `POST /workspace/mcp/:server/restart`

Capability tag: `workspace_mcp_restart`. Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/workspace/mcp/restart`.

Restart a configured MCP server through the ACP child's `McpClientManager.discoverMcpToolsForServer` (disconnect + reconnect + rediscover). Pre-checks the live budget snapshot from PR 14 v1's accounting so a restart on a budget-saturated workspace returns a soft refusal rather than triggering a `BudgetExhaustedError` cascade.

Request body is empty (`{}`). The path parameter is the URL-encoded server name as it appears in `mcpServers` config.

Response (200) — discriminated union on `restarted`:

```json
{ "serverName": "docs", "restarted": true, "durationMs": 1234 }
```

```json
{
  "serverName": "docs",
  "restarted": false,
  "skipped": true,
  "reason": "budget_would_exceed"
}
```

Soft skip reasons (all return 200):

| `reason`                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'in_flight'`           | Another discovery / restart for this server is already in progress. The route returns immediately rather than awaiting the original promise. Caller should retry after a short delay. |
| `'disabled'`            | Server is configured but listed in `excludedMcpServers`. Re-enable before restart.                                                                                                    |
| `'budget_would_exceed'` | Daemon is `--mcp-budget-mode=enforce`, the target server is not currently in `reservedSlots`, and the live total has reached `clientBudget`. Caller should free a slot first.         |

Errors (non-2xx):

- `400 {code: 'invalid_server_name'}` — empty path parameter.
- `404` — server name not in `mcpServers` config, or no live ACP channel exists (restart inherently requires a live `McpClientManager` instance).
- `500` — internal error (e.g. `ToolRegistry` not initialized).

SSE events (workspace-scoped): `mcp_server_restarted` with `{serverName, durationMs, originatorClientId?}` on success; `mcp_server_restart_refused` with `{serverName, reason, originatorClientId?}` on soft skip.

#### `POST /language`

Capability tag: `user_language_sync` (conditional — advertised only when settings persistence is available, same condition as `workspace_settings`). Bridge → ACP extMethod `qwen/control/user/language` per trusted runtime with a live channel.

Sessionless **user-level** language sync (issue #10234), for hosts that need to switch language before any session exists (e.g. a welcome page). Ownership classification: process-global — it mutates user-global state only (`~/.qwen/settings.json`, the global `~/.qwen/output-language.md`) plus best-effort runtime refresh, so it takes neither a workspace selector nor a session id. Registered behind the non-strict `mutate()` gate, matching the sibling `POST /session/:id/language`.

The daemon process is the single writer: it persists `general.language` (and, when `syncOutputLanguage` is true, `general.outputLanguage` plus the global `output-language.md`) before fanning out. Each trusted runtime then switches its own process UI language and reloads user-scope settings from disk; when `syncOutputLanguage` is true, it also refreshes every local session's system instruction. Differences from the session-scoped route:

- Project-bound output-language files are NOT rewritten — a session whose workspace has its own `.qwen/output-language.md` keeps that override (project scope wins on refresh).
- Zero sessions and zero live runtime channels are a **success**, not an error; a runtime without a live channel is skipped (not failed) and reads the persisted files when its channel next spawns.
- Untrusted workspace runtimes are skipped, matching the session route's `403 untrusted_workspace` posture.

Request:

```json
{ "language": "zh", "syncOutputLanguage": true }
```

`language` must be one of the codes listed in `/capabilities` `supportedLanguages` (plus `'auto'`); `syncOutputLanguage` defaults to `false`.

Response (200):

```json
{
  "language": "zh",
  "outputLanguage": "Chinese",
  "refresh": { "runtimes": 1, "sessions": 2, "failed": 0 }
}
```

`language` is the daemon-resolved UI locale, so an `'auto'` request can return a concrete language; hosts should read the persisted `general.language` setting for selector state. `outputLanguage` is `null` when `syncOutputLanguage` was false. `refresh.runtimes` counts runtimes that applied the switch over a live channel; `refresh.sessions` sums per-session system-instruction refreshes; `refresh.failed` aggregates per-session refresh failures and failed runtimes (fan-out is best-effort and never fails the request after persistence succeeded).

Errors:

- `400 {code: 'invalid_language', allowed: [...]}` — unknown language code.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_sync_flag'}` — `syncOutputLanguage` is non-boolean.
- `400 {code: 'invalid_client_id'}` — `X-Qwen-Client-Id` is not a client known to any runtime (header is optional; omit it when no session exists).
- `500 {code: 'persist_error'}` — user-settings or output-language file write failed; the failing step and everything after it did not run (earlier applied steps, such as the `general.language` write, are not rolled back).
- `404` — daemon predates the route, or was built without settings persistence (check the capability tag).

SSE event (workspace-scoped, on every runtime's session buses): `language_changed` with `{language, outputLanguage, userLevel: true, originatorClientId?}`. The `userLevel: true` marker distinguishes this fan-out from the session route's per-session event, which carries `sessionId` instead.

### `GET /session/:id/events` (SSE)

Subscribe to the session's event stream.

Headers:

```
Accept: text/event-stream
Last-Event-ID: 42        ← optional, replays from after id 42
X-Qwen-Event-Epoch: ...  ← optional, pairs the cursor with its bus epoch

A successful handshake includes `X-Qwen-SSE-Stream-Id: <uuid>`. Browser gateways must preserve that response header and expose it through `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. Old daemons or intermediaries may omit it; clients must continue normally and treat lineage as unavailable. The id identifies this physical REST/SSE connection and correlates its daemon lifecycle, queue diagnostics, and request trace.

Frame format. The `data:` line is the **full event envelope**, JSON-stringified on a single line — `{id?, v, type, data, originatorClientId?}`. The ACP-specific payload (`sessionUpdate`, `requestPermission` arguments, etc.) sits under the envelope's `data` field; the envelope's own `type` matches the SSE `event:` line.

```
id: 7
event: session_update
data: {"id":7,"v":1,"type":"session_update","data":{"sessionUpdate":"agent_message_chunk","content":{"type":"text","text":"…"}}}

id: 8
event: permission_request
data: {"id":8,"v":1,"type":"permission_request","data":{"requestId":"<uuid>","sessionId":"<sid>","toolCall":{...},"options":[...]}}

: heartbeat              ← every 15s, no payload

event: client_evicted    ← terminal frame, no id (synthetic)
data: {"v":1,"type":"client_evicted","data":{"reason":"queue_overflow","droppedAfter":42,"queueSize":256,"maxQueued":256,"queuedBytes":1800000,"maxQueuedBytes":2097152}}

event: client_evicted    ← terminal frame for byte overflow, no id (synthetic)
data: {"v":1,"type":"client_evicted","data":{"reason":"queue_bytes_overflow","droppedAfter":43,"queueSize":1,"maxQueued":256,"queuedBytes":1900000,"maxQueuedBytes":2097152,"eventBytes":300000}}

The SSE-level `id:` / `event:` lines duplicate `envelope.id` / `envelope.type` for EventSource compatibility. Raw-`fetch` consumers (the SDK's `parseSseStream`) read everything off the JSON envelope and ignore the SSE preamble lines.

Reconnect semantics:

- Send `Last-Event-ID: <n>` to replay events with `id > n` from the per-session ring (default depth **8000**, tunable via `qwen serve --event-ring-size <n>`).
- **Gap detection:** within the same epoch, if the first retained ring id is greater than `<n> + 1`, the daemon emits an id-less `state_resync_required` frame with `reason: 'ring_evicted'` before replaying the surviving suffix. The other reasons are `epoch_reset`, `seeded_replay_not_in_ring`, and `replay_budget_exceeded`; the budget signal follows the delivered replay prefix. See [resync reasons and ordering](./daemon/09-event-schema.md#resync-reasons-and-ordering) for their triggers, cursor fields, and recovery rules.
- The SDK latches `awaitingResync`; clients should call `POST /session/:id/load` and rebuild from the current bounded replay snapshot window. That snapshot may itself start with `history_truncated` when older in-memory replay entries were dropped; this marker is informational and must not start another resync loop. Its optional pagination anchor is [frozen at replay-window eviction](./daemon/09-event-schema.md#history-truncation-anchor).
- IDs are monotonic within a session's event-bus epoch, starting at 1. A rejected publish must not consume an id; see [event sequence invariants](./daemon/09-event-schema.md#state-and-forward-compatibility).
- Synthetic frames (`client_evicted`, `slow_client_warning`, `stream_error`, `state_resync_required`, `replay_complete`) intentionally omit `id` so they don't burn a sequence slot for other subscribers. `replay_complete` marks the end of replay, including empty or incomplete replay; it does not mean resync has completed.

Backpressure:

- Per-subscriber queue defaults to `maxQueued: 256` live items plus a daemon-owned 2 MiB live serialized-byte cap. Replay frames during reconnect, `slow_client_warning`, and `client_evicted` bypass both caps.
- Override only the frame cap via `?maxQueued=N` (range `[16, 2048]`) on the SSE request. There is deliberately no `?maxQueuedBytes`; clients cannot raise daemon memory budget.
- When a subscriber's live frame backlog or live byte backlog crosses 75% full the bus force-pushes a `slow_client_warning` synthetic frame to that subscriber (once per overflow episode; re-armed after both measurements drain below 37.5%). The stream stays open — the warning is a heads-up so the client can drain faster or detach + reconnect cleanly.
- If the live frame cap overflows, the bus emits `client_evicted` with `reason: "queue_overflow"`. If the live byte cap overflows, it emits `reason: "queue_bytes_overflow"`. In both cases the terminal frame is force-pushed and the subscription closes.

### `POST /session/:id/permission/:requestId`

Cast the same vote documented below, but route it through the runtime that owns
the named live session. New multi-workspace integrations should use this form
instead of the legacy process-global route. Pre-flight
`caps.features.session_permission_vote`.

The request body, mediation policies, outcomes, and success response are
identical to `POST /permission/:requestId`. The optional
`X-Qwen-Client-Id` header participates in designated and consensus policy.
Failures use stable `code` values where noted; malformed input and a lost
pending-request race can omit `code`:

- `400` — a malformed vote body (no `code`) or an invalid client identity
  (`invalid_client_id`), or `invalid_option_id` when the selected option was
  not offered. Re-read the offered options instead of retrying the same vote.
- `403` — `permission_forbidden` when the active policy rejects the voter, or
  `untrusted_workspace` when a non-primary owning workspace is not trusted.
  An untrusted primary owner is exempt from this trust check and the vote may
  be accepted.
- `404` — `session_not_found` when no live owner exists, or no `code` when the
  request is not pending.
- `500` — `cancel_sentinel_collision` when the agent's `allowedOptionIds`
  contains the reserved `__cancelled__` sentinel, or `ambiguous_session_owner`
  when more than one workspace claims the session.
- `501` — `permission_policy_not_implemented` for a policy this build does not
  implement.
- `503` — `workspace_runtime_unavailable` when the owning runtime is
  unavailable, or `daemon_draining` when the daemon is no longer accepting
  work.

It never retries against the primary bridge. The TypeScript SDK method is
`respondToSessionPermission()`.

### `POST /permission/:requestId`

Cast a vote on a pending `permission_request`. The active **mediation policy** decides who wins:

| Policy                      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `first-responder` (default) | Any validated voter wins; later voters get `404`. Pre-F3 baseline.                                                                                                                                    |
| `designated`                | Only the prompt originator (`originatorClientId`) decides; non-originators get `403 permission_forbidden / designated_mismatch`. Falls back to first-responder for anonymous prompts.                 |
| `consensus`                 | N-of-M voters must agree (default `N = floor(M/2) + 1`, override via `policy.consensusQuorum`). First option to reach `N` wins. Non-resolving votes get `200` + `permission_partial_vote` SSE frames. |
| `local-only`                | Only loopback voters decide; remote callers get `403 permission_forbidden / remote_not_allowed`.                                                                                                      |

The active policy is configured in `settings.json` under `policy.permissionStrategy` and surfaced on `/capabilities` at `body.policy.permission`. Pre-flight `caps.features.permission_mediation` (with `modes: [...]`) for the build-supported set.

> **F3 (#4175): multi-client permission coordination.** F3 added the four policies above. Pre-F3 daemons hardcoded first-responder; the wire shape stays bit-for-bit unchanged when the configured policy is `first-responder`. New events (`permission_partial_vote`, `permission_forbidden`) are additive — old SDKs see them as `unrecognized_known_event` and gracefully ignore.

Request:

```json
{
  "outcome": {
    "outcome": "selected",
    "optionId": "proceed_once"
  }
}
```

Outcomes:

- `{ "outcome": "selected", "optionId": "<one-of-the-options>" }` — accept / reject / proceed-once / etc, per the agent's offered choices
- `{ "outcome": "cancelled" }` — drop the request (matches what `cancelSession` / `shutdown` do internally)

Response:

- `200 {}` — your vote was accepted (resolved OR recorded under consensus quorum)
- `400` — a malformed vote body (no `code`), `invalid_client_id`, or
  `invalid_option_id` when the selected option was not offered; re-read the
  offered options instead of retrying the same vote
- `403 { "code": "permission_forbidden", "reason": "designated_mismatch" | "remote_not_allowed", "requestId", "sessionId" }` — F3: the active policy rejected your vote
- `404 { "error": "..." }` — the requestId is unknown (already resolved, never existed, or session torn down)
- `500 { "code": "cancel_sentinel_collision", ... }` — F3: the agent's `allowedOptionIds` contains the reserved sentinel `'__cancelled__'`; agent / daemon contract violation
- `501 { "code": "permission_policy_not_implemented", "policy": "<name>" }` — F3 forward-compat: a policy literal landed in the schema but its mediator branch isn't built yet (currently unreachable; reserved for future policies)

After a successful vote, every connected client sees `permission_resolved` with the same `requestId` and the chosen `outcome`. Under `consensus`, intermediate votes additionally fan out `permission_partial_vote` until quorum.

### Auth device-flow routes (issue #4175 PR 21)

The daemon brokers an OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) so a remote SDK client can trigger a login whose tokens land on the **daemon** filesystem — not on the client. The daemon polls the IdP itself; the client's only job is to display the verification URL + user code and (optionally) subscribe to SSE for completion events.

Capability tag: `auth_device_flow` (always advertised). Supported providers in
v1: `qwen-oauth`.

> [!note]
>
> Qwen OAuth free tier was discontinued on 2026-04-15. Treat `qwen-oauth` as the
> legacy v1 provider identifier in this protocol; new clients should prefer a
> currently supported auth provider when one is available.

**Runtime locality.** The daemon never spawns a browser — even if it can. The client decides whether to call `open(verificationUri)` locally; on a headless pod (the canonical Mode B deployment) the user opens the URL on whatever device they have a browser on. See `docs/users/qwen-serve.md` for the recommended UX.

**No token leakage in events.** `auth_device_flow_started` carries `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt}` only. The user code and verification URL come back point-to-point in the POST 201 body and via `GET /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id`; they are never broadcast on SSE.

**Per-provider singleton.** A second `POST` for the same provider while a flow is pending is an idempotent take-over — it returns the existing entry with `attached: true` rather than starting a fresh IdP request.

#### `POST /workspace/auth/device-flow`

Strict mutation gate: token-less trusted-loopback primary requests pass. A token-less primary request that reaches the gate without trusted-loopback authority receives `401 token_required`; missing or invalid configured credentials and unpaired Local Control credentials are rejected earlier with plain `401 Unauthorized`.

Request:

```json
{ "providerId": "qwen-oauth" }
```

Response (`201` fresh start, `200` idempotent take-over):

```json

  "attached": false
}
```

Errors:

- `400 unsupported_provider` — unknown `providerId` (response includes `supportedProviders`)
- `409 too_many_active_flows` — workspace cap (4) reached; cancel one with `DELETE`
- `401 token_required` — strict gate denied a token-less primary request without trusted-loopback authority
- `502 upstream_error` — IdP returned an unexpected error

#### `GET /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id`

Read the current state. Pending entries echo `userCode/verificationUri/expiresAt/intervalMs`; terminal entries (5-min grace) drop them and surface `status` + optional `errorKind/hint`.

Returns `404 device_flow_not_found` for unknown ids and post-grace evicted entries.

#### `DELETE /workspace/auth/device-flow/:id`

Idempotent cancel:

- pending entry → `204` + emit `auth_device_flow_cancelled`
- terminal entry → `204` no-op (no event re-emit)
- unknown id → `404`

#### `GET /workspace/auth/status`

Snapshot of pending flows + supported providers:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "workspaceCwd": "/work/bound",
  "providers": [],
  "pendingDeviceFlows": [
    {
      "deviceFlowId": "fa07c61b-…",
      "providerId": "qwen-oauth",
      "expiresAt": 1700000600000
    }
  ],
  "supportedDeviceFlowProviders": ["qwen-oauth"]
}
```

#### Device-flow SSE events

Five typed events (workspace-scoped, fanned out to every active session bus):

- `auth_device_flow_started` `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt}` — POST succeeded; SDK should subscribe (no userCode here, fetch via GET if needed)
- `auth_device_flow_throttled` `{deviceFlowId, intervalMs}` — daemon honored upstream `slow_down`; clients polling GET should bump their interval to match
- `auth_device_flow_authorized` `{deviceFlowId, providerId, expiresAt?, accountAlias?}` — credentials persisted; `accountAlias` is a non-PII label (never email/phone)
- `auth_device_flow_failed` `{deviceFlowId, errorKind, hint?}` — terminal; `errorKind` is one of `expired_token | access_denied | invalid_grant | upstream_error | persist_failed`. `persist_failed` is daemon-internal: the IdP exchange succeeded but the daemon couldn't durably store credentials (EACCES / EROFS / ENOSPC). The user should retry once the underlying disk condition is fixed.
- `auth_device_flow_cancelled` `{deviceFlowId}` — DELETE succeeded against a pending entry

> **Not MCP-compatible.** The MCP authorization spec (2025-06-18) mandates OAuth 2.1 + PKCE auth-code with a redirect callback, which doesn't work for headless-pod daemons. Mode B's device-flow surface is daemon-private — clients targeting MCP-compliant servers should use a different auth path.

## Streaming wire format

Events are emitted as standard EventSource frames. The daemon writes one `data:` line per frame (the JSON has no embedded newlines after `JSON.stringify`); the SDK parser at `packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon/sse.ts` handles both that and the spec-allowed multi-`data:` form on the receive side.

## Error frames during streaming

If the bridge iterator throws while serving an SSE subscriber, the daemon emits a terminal `stream_error` frame (no `id`). The `data:` line is the full envelope (same shape as every other SSE frame in this doc); the actual error message lives under `envelope.data.error`:

```
event: stream_error
data: {"v":1,"type":"stream_error","data":{"error":"<message>"}}
```

The connection then closes.
